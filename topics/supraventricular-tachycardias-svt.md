# Supraventricular tachycardias (SVT)

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- Assess stability now: if **hypotension**, **acute altered mental status**, **ischemic chest pain**, **shock**, or **acute pulmonary edema**, prepare **synchronized cardioversion** immediately; do not delay for labs.
- Attach monitor/defibrillator, O₂ if hypoxemic, IV access x2; get a 12-lead ECG but do not delay cardioversion if unstable.
- If stable and rhythm is **regular narrow-complex**, do **vagal maneuvers** (modified Valsalva) → **adenosine 6 mg rapid IV push + 20 mL flush**, then **12 mg** if needed.
- If stable and adenosine fails or diagnosis suggests atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia: rate control with **diltiazem IV** or **metoprolol IV** while reassessing BP and ischemia.
- Red flag: **irregular wide-complex tachycardia** or known **pre-excitation (WPW)** → avoid AV nodal blockers; consider **procainamide** and call cardiology/EP.
- Confirm Before Proceed: before cardioversion, confirm you are treating a tachyarrhythmia (not sinus tachycardia from sepsis/bleeding), and ensure appropriate monitoring/sedation plan if time allows.

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- SVT on night float usually presents as sudden-onset palpitations, dyspnea, chest pressure, or lightheadedness; start by separating **unstable vs stable** and **regular vs irregular** (monitor strip + 12-lead) because the initial pathway differs and delays can harm patients.
- **Guideline Must Know:** For any tachyarrhythmia, treat immediate threats first: airway/breathing, O₂ if hypoxemic, IV access, continuous monitoring, and identify reversible triggers (pain, hypovolemia, hypoxia, fever, anemia, withdrawal, stimulant use, missed beta blocker) while you pursue rhythm-specific care (AHA ACLS tachycardia algorithm; ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline).
- Unstable features mandate immediate synchronized cardioversion: **SBP <90 mmHg** or signs of shock, **acute pulmonary edema**, **ongoing ischemic chest discomfort**, or **acute altered mental status**; do not wait for troponin, magnesium, or a “better ECG.”
- **Guideline Must Know:** If the rhythm is **regular narrow-complex** and the patient is stable, start with vagal maneuvers (prefer modified Valsalva for higher success) as first-line therapy (ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline; AHA ACLS).
- **Guideline Must Know:** After vagal maneuvers, **adenosine** is first-line for acute termination of **regular SVT** (including AVNRT/orthodromic AVRT) using **6 mg rapid IV push + flush**, then **12 mg** if the first dose fails; place defib pads and warn staff/patient about transient flushing/chest pressure (ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline; AHA ACLS).
- Practical bedside tip: use a large-bore proximal IV (antecubital or central) and elevate the arm; slow push or distal IV is a common reason adenosine “fails.”
- **Guideline Must Know:** Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for hemodynamically unstable SVT when vagal maneuvers/adenosine are ineffective or not feasible, and for stable SVT when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated (ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline; AHA ACLS).
- If adenosine does not terminate the rhythm but transiently increases AV block, it can unmask atrial activity (flutter waves or atrial tachycardia), which helps you pivot from “terminate AV-node dependent SVT” to “rate control or rhythm strategy” and consult as needed.
- For stable SVT not responding to adenosine (or when atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia is likely), IV nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or beta blockers are reasonable: consider **diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 min**, repeat **0.35 mg/kg** if needed, then infusion **5–15 mg/h**; or **metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV q5 min** up to **15 mg** while monitoring BP and signs of heart failure (ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline).
- **Guideline Must Know:** Avoid AV nodal blockers (adenosine, diltiazem/verapamil, beta blockers, digoxin) in **pre-excited atrial fibrillation** (irregular wide-complex, very rapid ventricular rates) because blocking the AV node may accelerate conduction over the accessory pathway and precipitate ventricular fibrillation; use an agent like **procainamide** for stable patients and escalate urgently (ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline; ESC SVT guideline).
- Wide-complex tachycardia that is regular can be VT or SVT with aberrancy; if uncertain and stable, obtain expert help, correct electrolytes (goal **K⁺ ≥4.0 mmol/L**, **Mg²⁺ ≥1.0 mmol/L** as a practical antiarrhythmic strategy), and avoid therapies that could worsen an alternative diagnosis.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Consider electrophysiology evaluation for recurrent symptomatic SVT; EP study with option for catheter ablation is a guideline-supported definitive strategy for many SVTs and can be arranged inpatient if refractory or causing instability (ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline; ESC SVT guideline).
- What must happen now: identify instability, obtain a 12-lead ECG early, attempt vagal/adenosine for regular narrow SVT, treat ischemia/heart failure if present, and call for help early if there is pre-excitation, wide-complex ambiguity, recurrent episodes needing repeated IV drugs, or ongoing symptoms despite therapy.
- What can wait until daylight: detailed outpatient triggers (caffeine, stress, sleep deprivation), long-term rhythm prevention choices, and ambulatory monitoring plans if the inpatient episode fully resolves and there are no high-risk features.
- Night-float pitfalls: mistaking sinus tachycardia (sepsis/bleeding/PE) for SVT; giving repeated AV nodal blockers to pre-excited AF; failing to check medication history (missed beta blocker, stimulant, withdrawal); inadequate adenosine technique; delaying cardioversion in an unstable patient because “they’re talking.”
- Consult and disposition thinking: ICU if ongoing instability, need for repeated cardioversions, escalating oxygen/ventilatory support, or suspected ventricular arrhythmia; cardiology/EP if pre-excitation, recurrent refractory SVT, post-procedure arrhythmias, or suspected tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Any SVT with **hypotension**, **shock**, **acute pulmonary edema**, **ischemic chest pain**, or **acute altered mental status** requiring immediate synchronized cardioversion.
- **Recurrent SVT** requiring ≥2 rounds of IV therapy (multiple adenosine doses plus IV rate-control agent) or repeated cardioversion during the same shift.
- **Irregular wide-complex tachycardia**, suspected **pre-excited AF**, or uncertainty between VT vs SVT with aberrancy.
- Need for escalating respiratory support (new **HFNC/NIV**, rising work of breathing) or new **lactate elevation** with concern for low perfusion.

## Orders to Place Now (3–6 bullets)
- Order: Telemetry monitoring — {continuous rhythm monitoring; notify provider for HR >{threshold} or recurrent SVT}
- Order: 12-lead ECG — {now and repeat after conversion/therapy}
- Order: Adenosine IV push protocol — {dose 6 mg rapid IV push then 12 mg if needed; flush {20} mL; proximal IV site}
- Order: Diltiazem IV for rate control — {bolus 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 min; repeat 0.35 mg/kg; infusion 5–15 mg/h; hold for SBP <{90} or acute HF}
- Order: Metoprolol IV PRN rate control — {2.5–5 mg IV q5 min up to 15 mg; hold for SBP <{90}, HR <{60}, severe bronchospasm}
- Order: Electrolyte repletion protocol — {target K⁺ ≥4.0 mmol/L, Mg²⁺ ≥1.0 mmol/L; check BMP/Mg now}

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 62-year-old man with hypertension develops sudden palpitations on the medical floor. He is alert and speaking in full sentences. Vitals: T 36.8°C, HR 190/min, BP 128/74 mmHg, RR 18/min, SpO₂ 97% on room air. Telemetry shows a regular narrow-complex tachycardia. A 12-lead ECG shows no obvious flutter waves. He has no chest pain and no signs of heart failure. Modified Valsalva is attempted without conversion. What is the next best step?
### Options
A. Administer adenosine 6 mg rapid IV push followed by a saline flush
B. Administer digoxin IV for acute termination
C. Start an amiodarone infusion for acute termination
D. Give intravenous furosemide to reduce sympathetic tone
E. Perform immediate unsedated synchronized cardioversion
### Correct answer
A
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
For a hemodynamically stable, regular narrow-complex SVT, vagal maneuvers followed by **adenosine (6 mg rapid IV push, then 12 mg if needed)** is first-line for acute termination per ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guidance and aligns with the ACLS tachycardia algorithm. Digoxin and amiodarone are not first-line for acute termination of regular SVT, and cardioversion is reserved for instability or when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated.

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 28-year-old woman with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is admitted for pyelonephritis. She suddenly develops palpitations and anxiety. Vitals: HR 220/min, BP 110/68 mmHg, RR 20/min, SpO₂ 96% on room air. Telemetry shows an irregular wide-complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphology. She is awake and not in respiratory distress. What is the best next step?
### Options
A. Administer intravenous diltiazem for rate control
B. Administer adenosine rapid IV push to diagnose and terminate SVT
C. Administer procainamide intravenous infusion for rhythm control
D. Administer intravenous metoprolol to slow AV nodal conduction
E. Observe because she is hemodynamically stable
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
An **irregular wide-complex tachycardia** in a patient with known WPW is concerning for **pre-excited atrial fibrillation**, where AV nodal blockers (adenosine, diltiazem, beta blockers) can worsen ventricular response and precipitate ventricular fibrillation per SVT guidelines. The pitfall is treating it like typical SVT or AF with AV nodal blockade; **procainamide** is an appropriate stable rhythm-control option while arranging urgent cardiology/EP support and readiness for cardioversion.
What changed the decision here?
