# Prosthetic valves & anticoagulation basics
## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- ABCs + hemodynamics first; if unstable bleeding or shock: 2 large-bore IVs, type and screen, rapid transfusion as needed, target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**.
- If major/life-threatening bleed on warfarin: hold warfarin, give **4-factor PCC** + **vitamin K 10 mg IV**; control source urgently; **Confirm Before Proceed:** verify bleeding is major/critical-site and anticoagulant is VKA.
- If mechanical valve + suspected valve thrombosis/obstruction (acute dyspnea, pulmonary edema, new muffled mechanical clicks, rising gradients): urgent TTE/TEE, call cardiology/CT surgery; if no active bleeding, start **unfractionated heparin infusion** (weight-based) while awaiting imaging.
- If subtherapeutic INR in a mechanical valve with high thrombotic risk (mechanical mitral, older-generation valves, prior embolism): start therapeutic anticoagulation bridge (usually **IV UFH**) and consult cardiology.
- If urgent procedure needed: identify valve type/position and thrombotic risk; if high risk (especially mechanical mitral), discuss bridging plan now; avoid “routine” holding without a plan.

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float first question is always: “What valve and where?” Mechanical valves mandate lifelong VKA; bioprosthetic valves (surgical or transcatheter) often need antiplatelet alone after an initial period unless there’s another indication (e.g., atrial fibrillation, VTE).
- **Guideline Must Know:** Mechanical valves require a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin); **DOACs are contraindicated** in mechanical prostheses (harm signal in trials; reinforced in major valve guidelines).
- **Guideline Must Know:** INR targets depend on valve position/type and patient risk factors: mechanical aortic (current-generation bileaflet/single-tilting disk) with no risk factors targets **INR 2.5**; mechanical aortic with thromboembolic risk factors or older-generation targets **INR 3.0**; mechanical mitral targets **INR 3.0**.
- **Guideline Must Know:** The On-X mechanical aortic valve is the notable exception where a lower target **INR 1.5–2.0** may be used **starting 3 months post-op** with added **aspirin 75–100 mg daily**, but only if no thromboembolic risk factors and done with a deliberate cardiology plan.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Bioprosthetic TAVI/SAVR or bioprosthetic mitral replacement: **aspirin 75–100 mg daily is reasonable** long term if no other anticoagulation indication; for surgical bioprosthetic AVR/MVR, **warfarin to INR 2.5 for 3–6 months** post-op is reasonable (common source of missed therapy on discharge and readmissions).
- **Guideline Must Know:** Atrial fibrillation with valvular disease: DOACs are generally acceptable for most native valve lesions and for bioprostheses after the early post-implant period, but **not** for **mechanical valves** and **not** for clinically significant rheumatic mitral stenosis; clarify the exact diagnosis (night-float pitfall: “valvular AF” used imprecisely).
- **Guideline Must Know:** Peri-procedural management is risk balancing: many patients can hold warfarin without bridging, but high thrombotic-risk groups (notably **mechanical mitral valves**, recent stroke/systemic embolism, older-generation valves) may benefit from bridging with heparin; do not default to “bridge everyone.”
- Major bleed definition matters because it changes everything: bleeding in a critical site, hemodynamic instability, **Hb drop ≥2 g/dL**, or **≥2 units PRBCs** qualifies as major and typically warrants immediate anticoagulant interruption and reversal strategy rather than “watchful waiting.”
- Warfarin reversal basics at night: for life-threatening or persistent major bleeding, **4-factor PCC** is preferred for rapid reversal; add **vitamin K 10 mg IV** to sustain reversal (PCC alone wears off). If PCC unavailable, use plasma while arranging definitive therapy. **Confirm Before Proceed:** confirm the agent is warfarin (not a DOAC) and assess thrombotic risk; document the rationale.
- Non-major supratherapeutic INR (no bleeding) is usually managed by holding warfarin and close INR recheck; avoid reflex vitamin K unless INR is very high or bleeding risk is extreme, because overcorrection increases time subtherapeutic in mechanical valves (a common night-float swing error).
- Suspected prosthetic valve thrombosis/obstruction is a time-sensitive emergency: clues include dyspnea/pulmonary edema, hypotension, new or changing murmur, diminished mechanical click, hemolysis, or unexplained heart failure. Get urgent echocardiography (TTE, often TEE) and early cardiology/CT surgery; anticoagulation with **IV UFH** is commonly initiated if bleeding risk allows while definitive diagnosis/therapy is arranged.
- Endocarditis prophylaxis is not a “routine antibiotic” for all procedures: patients with prosthetic valves generally qualify for prophylaxis for high-risk dental procedures, not for routine GI/GU procedures without infection; don’t start overnight antibiotics “just because prosthetic valve” unless there are clinical infection indicators and cultures are obtained first.
- Practical inpatient warfarin management: check interacting drugs (amiodarone, azoles, TMP-SMX, metronidazole), nutrition changes, liver dysfunction, and antibiotic starts; create a plan with a clear INR goal (write it) and a contingency for missed doses or NPO status.
- Restarting anticoagulation after bleeding is nuanced but should be planned early: once hemostasis is achieved, reassess thrombotic risk (mechanical valves are high risk) and coordinate timing with procedural teams; bridging with **UFH** can be considered when rapid on/off control is needed.
- Call for help early when the plan is irreversible or high-stakes: **Confirm Before Proceed** for emergent reversal (PCC/IV vitamin K), thrombolysis/surgery decisions for valve thrombosis, or when holding anticoagulation in a mechanical mitral valve for any reason.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Suspected prosthetic valve obstruction/thrombosis with respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, syncope, or shock, or rising echo gradients with symptoms.
- Major/critical-site bleeding on anticoagulants (hemodynamic instability, **Hb drop ≥2 g/dL**, or **≥2 units PRBCs**) requiring rapid reversal and source control.
- New neurologic deficit in a prosthetic valve patient (possible embolic stroke/endocarditis complication) or concern for intracranial hemorrhage on anticoagulation.
- Need for emergent surgery/procedure in a high thrombotic-risk mechanical valve patient where anticoagulation interruption/bridging must be coordinated now.

## Orders to Place Now (3–6 bullets)
- Order: STAT PT/INR, aPTT, CBC, CMP — {draw now; repeat interval in hours}
- Order: Type and screen (and crossmatch) — {units PRBCs to prepare; transfusion threshold}
- Order: Transthoracic echocardiogram STAT — {indication: suspected prosthetic dysfunction/gradient change; valve position/type if known}
- Order: Unfractionated heparin infusion (therapeutic protocol) — {weight_kg; bolus yes/no; anti-Xa or aPTT monitoring target; hold parameters}
- Order: 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate + phytonadione (vitamin K) IV — {PCC dose strategy per protocol; vitamin K 10 mg IV; indication: major bleed on warfarin}

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 62-year-old man with a history of mechanical bileaflet aortic valve replacement 2 years ago is admitted for community-acquired pneumonia. He has no atrial fibrillation, prior thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction, or known hypercoagulable disorder. His home medication is warfarin. Which INR target is most appropriate for chronic anticoagulation?
### Options
A. INR 1.5–2.0 starting immediately after surgery with aspirin
B. INR 2.0
C. INR 2.5
D. INR 3.0
E. No anticoagulation is needed long term
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
For a current-generation mechanical bileaflet aortic valve with no thromboembolic risk factors, guideline-directed therapy is VKA anticoagulation with a target **INR 2.5**. Lower INR targets (e.g., **1.5–2.0**) are reserved for select On-X aortic valves starting **≥3 months** post-op with aspirin, and higher targets (**INR 3.0**) are used for older-generation valves or additional thromboembolic risk factors.

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 70-year-old woman with a mechanical mitral valve presents with hematemesis and melena. BP is 86/52 mmHg, HR 122/min. Hemoglobin is 6.9 g/dL and INR is 5.8 on warfarin. She is actively bleeding and requires emergent endoscopy. What is the best next step?
### Options
A. Hold warfarin only and repeat INR in 6 hours
B. Give vitamin K 2.5 mg orally and schedule endoscopy for the morning
C. Start unfractionated heparin infusion immediately and proceed to endoscopy without reversal
D. Administer 4-factor PCC and vitamin K 10 mg IV while resuscitating and arranging urgent endoscopy
E. Administer aspirin 325 mg and clopidogrel to prevent valve thrombosis
### Correct answer
D
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This is life-threatening major GI bleeding with shock in a patient on warfarin, so rapid reversal with **4-factor PCC** plus **vitamin K 10 mg IV** is indicated while simultaneously resuscitating and controlling the source. The pitfall is under-reversing (or delaying reversal) out of fear of mechanical-valve thrombosis; immediate hemostasis takes priority, with a plan to restart anticoagulation once bleeding is controlled. What changed the decision here?
