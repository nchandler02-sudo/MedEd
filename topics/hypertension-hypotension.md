# Hypertension & hypotension

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- Recheck vitals immediately: manual BP (correct cuff/position), orthostatics if safe, confirm waveform if arterial line; treat pain/anxiety/hypoxia while you reassess. citeturn2search34
- If hypotensive or altered: ABCs, **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia), 2 large-bore IVs, bedside glucose, focused exam for shock; start **500–1,000 mL balanced crystalloid** if no pulmonary edema, reassess after each bolus. citeturn2search47
- If septic shock likely: obtain lactate and cultures, start broad-spectrum antibiotics, give **30 mL/kg** crystalloid for hypotension or lactate elevation, target **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; start **norepinephrine** if MAP not achieved after initial fluids or if fluid-intolerant. citeturn2search47
- If hypertensive emergency suspected (severe BP with acute target-organ damage): place on continuous monitoring, consider arterial line, start IV agent matched to pathology; aim for **~10–20% MAP reduction in first hour** unless condition-specific target overrides. Confirm Before Proceed: do not rapidly lower BP in possible acute ischemic stroke without reperfusion plan. citeturn2search34turn2search1
- If chest/back tearing pain, pulse deficit, neuro deficit, flash pulmonary edema, or ICH signs: call ICU and specialty early; treat dissection with **HR <60 bpm** and **SBP 100–120 mmHg** using IV beta-blocker before vasodilator. Confirm Before Proceed: confirm suspected dissection pathway before isolated vasodilator. citeturn2search14

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float first move is classification, not reflex treatment: is this true BP signal (measurement error, pain, agitation, withdrawal, meds/fluids), and is there acute end-organ injury (brain, heart, aorta, kidney, retina)? Treat the patient, not the number. citeturn2search34
- **Guideline Must Know:** In acute care, avoid the term “hypertensive urgency”; distinguish **hypertensive emergency** (severe BP with **new/worsening target-organ damage**) from **asymptomatic markedly elevated BP** (severe BP without injury) and **asymptomatic elevated BP**. Most asymptomatic cases do not need IV BP meds overnight. citeturn2search34
- What must happen now (hypertension): screen for injury with focused neuro exam/mental status, chest pain/ischemia, pulmonary edema, aortic syndrome features, urine output/creatinine trend, and appropriate tests (ECG, troponin if indicated, CXR, CMP/UA). What can wait: long-term regimen optimization unless compelling inpatient reason. citeturn2search34
- **Guideline Must Know:** If acute ischemic stroke is possible, BP strategy depends on reperfusion eligibility: for IV thrombolysis, BP must be **≤185/110 mmHg** before treatment and **≤180/105 mmHg** after; if no reperfusion planned, permissive hypertension is often reasonable unless **SBP >220** or **DBP >120 mmHg** or another indication exists. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** For suspected aortic dissection/acute aortic syndrome, reduce shear first: IV beta-blocker (e.g., esmolol) targeting **HR <60 bpm**, then titrate BP to **SBP 100–120 mmHg**; avoid vasodilator monotherapy that can trigger reflex tachycardia. citeturn2search14
- Hypertensive emergency medication matching (common night-float patterns): flash pulmonary edema favors IV nitroglycerin plus noninvasive ventilation; neurologic emergencies often prefer titratable agents (nicardipine/clevidipine) with close neuro monitoring; avoid precipitous drops and monitor for ischemia. citeturn2search34turn2search37
- Pitfalls with PRN IV antihypertensives: IV hydralazine has unpredictable duration and overshoot hypotension; short-acting nifedipine is unsafe for acute BP control; “treating the number” can precipitate stroke/AKI. Escalate only when organ injury or procedure-specific target requires it. citeturn2search34
- Transition planning (can wait but don’t forget): if persistently elevated inpatient BP without injury, address reversible causes (pain, volume overload, steroids/NSAIDs, withdrawal), reconcile home meds, and set an outpatient plan rather than stacking new agents at 2 AM. citeturn2search34turn2search43
- Hypotension: start with physiology and speed. Confirm true hypotension (cuff size, arrhythmia, a-line damping), then identify shock pattern: distributive (warm), hypovolemic (dry), cardiogenic (pulmonary edema/JVP), obstructive (tamponade/PE/tension PTX). Use bedside ultrasound early when available. citeturn2search47
- **Guideline Must Know:** In septic shock, initial resuscitation targets **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; give crystalloids early (often **30 mL/kg** for hypotension or lactate elevation) while reassessing for fluid responsiveness and overload; start vasopressors early when hypotension persists. citeturn2search47
- **Guideline Must Know:** First-line vasopressor for septic shock is **norepinephrine**; add **vasopressin** (fixed-dose) when escalating norepinephrine or to reduce catecholamine dose; consider **epinephrine** as an additional agent in refractory shock; reassess for myocardial dysfunction and ongoing hypovolemia. citeturn2search47
- If hypotension with bradycardia: think medication effect (beta-blocker, non-dihydropyridine CCB, clonidine), hyperkalemia, heart block, or inferior MI; treat rhythm and reversible causes while supporting perfusion. Confirm Before Proceed: don’t chase BP with vasodilators or additional antihypertensives if the problem is iatrogenic. citeturn2search47
- Special-risk contexts to auto-flag overnight: pregnancy/postpartum, severe CKD/ESRD (fluid and renally-cleared meds), cirrhosis (vasodilatory physiology), QT-prolongation risk (avoid triggering torsades), active GI bleed (volume and transfusion strategy), and chronic hypertension (relative cerebral perfusion). citeturn2search47turn2search43
- Objective documentation and communication are night-float superpowers: record pre/post intervention BP with technique, symptoms, exam findings of organ injury, urine output trend, lactate/creatinine trends, and your escalation rationale (why ICU/consult now). citeturn2search34turn2search47

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Persistent hypotension **MAP <65 mmHg** after initial fluids or need for vasopressor infusion; lactate rising or new organ dysfunction (oliguria, escalating oxygen/vent support, worsening mental status). citeturn2search47
- Hypertensive emergency features: acute neuro deficits/encephalopathy, suspected ICH, acute coronary syndrome, flash pulmonary edema, or suspected aortic dissection. citeturn2search34turn2search14turn2search37
- Escalating respiratory failure: need for **HFNC**, **BiPAP**, or impending intubation in the setting of hypotension or hypertensive pulmonary edema. citeturn2search47
- Arrhythmia with hemodynamic instability (new rapid AF with shock, high-grade AV block, VT) or ischemic ECG changes with symptoms. citeturn2search47

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 64-year-old man is admitted for cellulitis and pain control. Overnight his automated blood pressure is 198/112 mmHg. He is afebrile, denies chest pain, dyspnea, headache, or vision changes, and his neurologic exam is normal. He is anxious and rates his leg pain as 9/10. Creatinine is unchanged from baseline, and urine output is normal. What is the most appropriate next step?
### Options
A. Give IV hydralazine 10 mg now and recheck blood pressure in 30 minutes
B. Start IV nicardipine infusion and transfer to the ICU for continuous BP titration
C. Repeat blood pressure with proper technique, treat pain/anxiety, and resume home oral antihypertensives if due
D. Order emergent head CT to evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage before any intervention
E. Give sublingual nifedipine for rapid blood pressure reduction
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
In acute care settings, severe BP without new or worsening target-organ damage is classified as asymptomatic markedly elevated BP and generally does not require IV antihypertensives; measurement optimization and addressing reversible drivers (pain, anxiety) are prioritized. citeturn2search34 IV hydralazine and short-acting nifedipine can cause unpredictable overshoot hypotension and harm, whereas ICU titration is reserved for true hypertensive emergency with organ injury. citeturn2search34

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 58-year-old woman presents with sudden severe tearing chest and back pain. BP is 210/120 mmHg in the right arm and 180/105 mmHg in the left; HR is 118 bpm. She is diaphoretic and anxious. You suspect acute aortic dissection. Which medication strategy is most appropriate to start now?
### Options
A. Start IV nitroprusside and titrate rapidly to SBP 120 mmHg
B. Start IV nicardipine infusion and titrate to SBP 140 mmHg
C. Start IV esmolol, titrate to HR <60 bpm, then add a titratable vasodilator if SBP remains >120 mmHg
D. Give oral clonidine and reassess in 1 hour
E. Give IV hydralazine boluses until SBP <140 mmHg
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
In suspected acute aortic syndrome, guideline-directed therapy prioritizes reducing aortic shear by controlling heart rate first (target **HR <60 bpm**) with an IV beta-blocker, then lowering BP (often **SBP 100–120 mmHg**) with an additional agent if needed. citeturn2search14 The pitfall is starting vasodilator therapy without beta-blockade, which can provoke reflex tachycardia and worsen dissection propagation. citeturn2search14
