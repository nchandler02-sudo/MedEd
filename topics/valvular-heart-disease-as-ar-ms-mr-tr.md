# Valvular heart disease (AS/AR/MS/MR/TR)

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- ABCs + monitor + 2 large-bore IV + STAT ECG; treat as cardiogenic pulmonary edema/shock until proven otherwise; target **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia) and **MAP ≥65 mmHg**.
- If hypotensive with suspected severe AS/MS: avoid sudden preload/afterload drops; give **250–500 mL** cautious crystalloid bolus if underfilled, start **norepinephrine 0.02–0.3 microg/kg/min** (or **phenylephrine 0.2–2 microg/kg/min**) to **MAP ≥65** while you obtain urgent echo. citeturn3search1
- If hypertensive flash pulmonary edema from regurgitant lesions (MR/AR) and perfusing: start noninvasive ventilation; give **furosemide 40–80 mg IV** and **nitroglycerin infusion 10–200 microg/min** titrate to **SBP >100 mmHg** (avoid if severe AS suspected). citeturn3search1turn3search15
- New murmur + acute pulmonary edema/shock/ischemia: order **STAT transthoracic echo** (TEE if nondiagnostic) and call cardiology early; treat AF with RVR by stabilizing BP first (avoid aggressive beta-blockade if decompensated severe AS/acute AR). citeturn3search1turn3search15
- Confirm Before Proceed: if considering urgent cardioversion for unstable AF, ensure no alternative cause of instability (sepsis/bleeding/PE) and prepare airway/pressors; if mechanical valve or rheumatic MS suspected, do not start a DOAC. citeturn3search1

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float framing: most dangerous presentations are decompensated HF (flash edema), cardiogenic shock, and AF with RVR triggered/worsened by AS/MS/MR; your first job is to identify lesion pattern (obstructive vs regurgitant) because “standard CHF meds” can crash preload-dependent severe AS/MS. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- **Guideline Must Know:** In suspected severe symptomatic AS (syncope/angina/dyspnea) or shock, prioritize hemodynamic stability and urgent echo/valve-team involvement; avoid abrupt vasodilation and excessive diuresis—maintain sinus rhythm, avoid tachycardia, and support **MAP ≥65 mmHg** with vasopressors. citeturn3search1turn3search2
- AS physiology at night: fixed outflow obstruction means cardiac output cannot rise; hypotension begets ischemia. Practical sequence: small fluid challenges if underfilled, pressor support, treat precipitant (AF, bleeding, sepsis), and call cardiology for consideration of urgent valve intervention/bridge (balloon valvuloplasty in select unstable patients). citeturn3search1turn3search2
- **Guideline Must Know:** Acute severe AR (often endocarditis/aortic dissection) is a surgical emergency—medical therapy is temporizing only; avoid beta-blockers (prolong diastole, increase regurgitant volume), consider afterload reduction if perfusing, and escalate urgently for TEE/surgery. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- AR at the bedside: wide pulse pressure, bounding pulses may be absent in acute AR; pulmonary edema + hypotension can occur rapidly. If hypertensive/perfusing: vasodilate (e.g., nitroprusside) + inotrope if needed; if hypotensive: norepinephrine/inotrope while arranging emergent imaging/consult. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- **Guideline Must Know:** In AF with native valve disease, oral anticoagulation choice depends on lesion: DOACs are acceptable for most native valve lesions and bioprostheses, but are not recommended for **rheumatic moderate-to-severe MS** and are contraindicated in **mechanical valves** (use vitamin K antagonist). citeturn3search1turn3search15
- MS night-float pitfalls: tachycardia shortens diastolic filling, rapidly increases LA pressure → pulmonary edema; aim for controlled ventricular rate, gentle diuresis, and avoid over-diuresis if RV/low-output. If unstable due to AF with RVR, synchronized cardioversion is appropriate. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- **Guideline Must Know:** Severe symptomatic MS or MS with recurrent pulmonary edema despite medical therapy should prompt early specialist evaluation (balloon mitral valvotomy vs surgery depending on anatomy/etiology); don’t “treat and wait” through repeated decompensations overnight. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- MR pattern recognition: acute severe MR (papillary muscle rupture, chordal rupture, endocarditis) causes abrupt pulmonary edema and shock with often hyperdynamic LV and new holosystolic murmur that may be soft; chronic MR decompensates with volume overload. Acute severe MR needs urgent cardiology/cardiothoracic input. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- **Guideline Must Know:** Medical stabilization for acute severe MR focuses on reducing afterload and congestion (if perfusing) while expediting definitive repair/replacement; treat ischemia promptly when MI-related and consider mechanical support in refractory shock. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- TR at night: most TR is functional from RV dilation/pulmonary hypertension/left-sided disease; the immediate inpatient lever is volume management and treating triggers (hypoxia, PE, uncontrolled AF). Watch for cardiorenal syndrome and congestive hepatopathy; diurese with clear endpoints and daily weights/urine goals. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- **Guideline Must Know:** Severe TR with right-sided HF signs, progressive end-organ congestion, or need for escalating diuretics warrants specialist evaluation; earlier referral is emphasized because late TR surgery/intervention has worse outcomes. citeturn3search15turn3search7
- What must happen now (first 30–60 min): bedside assessment for shock/respiratory failure, ECG + troponin if ischemia suspected, CXR, labs (CBC/CMP/Mg/BNP if helpful), start oxygen/NIV, choose hemodynamics based on lesion type, and order **STAT echo** for any new instability/new murmur/flash edema. citeturn3search1turn3search2
- What can wait (after stabilization): definitive lesion quantification and chronic regimen alignment (HF meds, BP control, rhythm strategy, anticoagulation plan, follow-up imaging cadence), but do not delay consult if you have severe symptomatic lesions, suspected acute AR/MR, or recurrent nocturnal decompensation. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- High-yield medication cautions: in severe AS/MS, avoid large preload reductions (high-dose nitrates/aggressive diuresis) unless clearly hypertensive and monitored; in acute AR avoid beta-blockers; in decompensated valve HF, avoid nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers if HFrEF. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- Call patterns that save lives: don’t “wait for day team” with acute AR/MR, refractory pulmonary edema, syncope with suspected severe AS, or persistent hypotension—these are time-sensitive structural emergencies where early cardiology/CT surgery input changes outcomes. citeturn3search1turn3search2turn3search15

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Need for **NIV with escalating FiO₂/pressure**, impending intubation, or persistent **SpO₂ <90%** despite NIV/diuresis suggests severe acute MR/AR or critical MS and warrants ICU + urgent cardiology. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- Hemodynamic instability: **MAP <65 mmHg** after **500–1000 mL** judicious fluids and/or requiring vasopressors, lactate rising, or new altered mental status → ICU and urgent echo/structural evaluation. citeturn3search1
- Malignant arrhythmia or AF with RVR **>150 bpm** causing ischemia/hypotension/pulmonary edema (especially with MS/AS) → cardiology and consideration of urgent cardioversion/advanced support. citeturn3search1turn3search15
- Suspected acute severe AR/MR (new murmur + flash edema/shock, endocarditis/dissection concern) or mechanical valve complication → emergent cardiology + CT surgery discussion and TEE planning. citeturn3search1turn3search15

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 62-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic heart disease is admitted for dyspnea. Transthoracic echocardiography shows mitral stenosis with a mitral valve area of 1.1 cm² and marked left atrial enlargement. Overnight she develops new atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 130/min and remains hemodynamically stable after diuresis. Her CHA₂DS₂-VASc score is 1. Which anticoagulation strategy is most appropriate?
### Options
A. Apixaban
B. Dabigatran
C. Rivaroxaban
D. Warfarin with INR goal 2.0–3.0
E. No anticoagulation because CHA₂DS₂-VASc is low
### Correct answer
D
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Rheumatic **moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis** with atrial fibrillation requires anticoagulation with a **vitamin K antagonist**; DOACs are not recommended in this setting, regardless of CHA₂DS₂-VASc. citeturn3search1turn3search15

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 74-year-old man with severe degenerative mitral regurgitation is admitted for volume overload. Overnight he develops new atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 120/min; blood pressure is stable and there is no rheumatic disease history. Echo confirms mitral regurgitation without mitral stenosis and no mechanical valve. Which anticoagulant is most appropriate for stroke prevention?
### Options
A. Apixaban
B. Dabigatran
C. Edoxaban
D. Rivaroxaban
E. Warfarin because any “valvular” atrial fibrillation requires it
### Correct answer
A
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
For atrial fibrillation with **native valve regurgitation** (without rheumatic moderate-to-severe MS and without mechanical valve), DOAC therapy is acceptable and preferred by many clinicians due to ease of use and outcomes data; warfarin is not required solely due to MR. The pitfall is mislabeling all valve disease as “valvular AF.” citeturn3search1turn3search15
