# Pericardial disease (pericarditis, tamponade, constriction)

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If shock or severe dyspnea: airway/oxygen, 2 large-bore IV, monitor, bedside ECG + focused cardiac ultrasound now; aim **MAP ≥65 mmHg** and treat hypotension with **250–500 mL** boluses if not volume overloaded while preparing definitive drainage if tamponade.
- Suspect tamponade if hypotension + tachycardia + JVP elevation + muffled heart sounds or ultrasound showing large effusion with RA/RV diastolic collapse; avoid vasodilators/diuretics; start norepinephrine **0.05–0.5 mcg/kg/min** if persistent hypotension while arranging urgent pericardiocentesis.
- If acute pericarditis pain: give NSAID first-line (if no contraindication) plus colchicine; target rapid pain control and inflammation reduction while ruling out MI and high-risk etiologies (purulent, TB, malignancy, uremic).
- If electrical alternans, pulsus paradoxus **>10–12 mmHg**, or escalating oxygen/pressor needs: call ICU and cardiology immediately; prepare for emergent drainage.
- Confirm Before Proceed: before pericardiocentesis or surgical window, confirm effusion + hemodynamic compromise on echo, review anticoagulation/platelets/INR, and choose safest approach with cardiology/cardiothoracic surgery.

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-shift first move is pattern recognition: pericarditis (pleuritic chest pain better leaning forward + pericardial rub + diffuse ST elevation/PR depression), tamponade (obstructive shock physiology), constriction (right-sided failure signs with preserved systolic function); get ECG, troponin, CBC/CMP, CRP/ESR, and bedside echo early to separate these rapidly.
- Now: rule out STEMI and aortic catastrophe before anchoring; diffuse concave ST elevation with PR depression favors pericarditis, but focal ST elevation, reciprocal changes, or rising troponin with wall-motion abnormality suggests ACS/myopericarditis—treat the life-threatening diagnosis first and involve cardiology early if uncertain.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Acute pericarditis first-line therapy is anti-inflammatory dosing NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen **600–800 mg PO q8h** or aspirin **750–1000 mg PO q8h**) plus colchicine **0.5–0.6 mg** once daily (<70 kg) or **0.5–0.6 mg BID** (≥70 kg) for **3 months**; taper NSAID after symptom/CRP improvement to reduce recurrence (ESC Pericardial Diseases 2015).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Admit/high-risk features: fever **>38°C**, subacute onset, large effusion (**echo diastolic-free space >20 mm**), tamponade physiology, immunosuppression, trauma, oral anticoagulation, or failure to improve within **7 days**—these warrant inpatient monitoring and etiologic workup (ESC Pericardial Diseases 2015).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Glucocorticoids are not first-line for idiopathic/viral pericarditis because they increase recurrence; reserve for specific indications (autoimmune, uremic, pregnancy when NSAIDs contraindicated) using lowest effective dose (e.g., prednisone **0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day**) with slow taper and always with colchicine if possible (ESC Pericardial Diseases 2015).
- Colchicine pitfalls on nights: adjust/avoid in severe CKD/ESRD and with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors; watch for diarrhea and myotoxicity (especially with statins); if severe renal impairment, consider reduced dosing (e.g., **0.3 mg daily** if used) and pharmacy input.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Tamponade is a clinical-echo diagnosis and is treated with urgent drainage when there is hemodynamic compromise; temporize with cautious IV fluids and vasopressors, but definitive management is pericardiocentesis or surgical drainage depending on etiology/loculations/post-op status (ESC Pericardial Diseases 2015).
- Tamponade bedside echo cues: large circumferential effusion, RA systolic collapse, RV diastolic collapse, plethoric IVC with reduced inspiratory collapse, marked respiratory variation in transvalvular Doppler flows; a small effusion can still tamponade if rapidly accumulating (post-procedure/trauma).
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Avoid positive-pressure ventilation when possible in unstable tamponade because it can reduce venous return and precipitate collapse; if intubation unavoidable, preload, have pressors running, and coordinate immediate drainage capability (obstructive shock physiology; ESC Pericardial Diseases 2015 emphasizes urgent drainage with hemodynamic compromise).
- Etiology drives what can wait: Now—if suspected purulent pericarditis (toxic, high fever, leukocytosis) or TB/malignancy clues, involve cardiology/ID and obtain blood cultures; purulent pericarditis needs urgent drainage plus broad antibiotics. Can wait—expanded autoimmune/malignancy evaluation once stable.
- Myopericarditis nuance: mild troponin elevation with preserved LV function is often supportive care with activity restriction; but heart failure, arrhythmias, or reduced EF pushes ICU-level monitoring and cardiology; avoid high-dose NSAIDs in frank myocarditis with LV dysfunction when concern for worsening renal perfusion or fluid retention.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Anticoagulated patients with effusion are higher risk for hemorrhagic tamponade; hold anticoagulation and reverse only if life-threatening bleeding/hemodynamic compromise—coordinate with cardiology and use agent-specific reversal (e.g., PCC for warfarin, idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa or PCC-based strategy per institutional availability) before invasive drainage when feasible (ESC Pericardial Diseases 2015 highlights anticoagulation as a risk feature).
- Constrictive pericarditis on nights: think of chronic right-sided congestion (ascites, edema, elevated JVP) with relatively preserved EF, Kussmaul sign, pericardial knock; diuretics can improve symptoms but excessive preload reduction can drop cardiac output—titrate cautiously and ensure follow-up imaging/hemodynamic evaluation.
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** Differentiating constriction from restrictive cardiomyopathy hinges on echo/CMR/hemodynamics (respiratory interventricular dependence, septal bounce, hepatic vein flow reversal); definitive therapy for chronic constriction is pericardiectomy in appropriate candidates, while transient/inflammatory constriction may respond to anti-inflammatories (ESC Pericardial Diseases 2015).
- Night-float “what must happen now” summary: stabilize ABCs, confirm physiology with bedside echo, identify high-risk features, start NSAID+colchicine for uncomplicated pericarditis, and escalate urgently for tamponade/purulent/TB/malignancy suspicion; “what can wait” is extensive etiologic testing once stable and consult-directed.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Suspected tamponade with hypotension or escalating support: **SBP <90 mmHg**, **MAP <65 mmHg**, rising lactate, altered mental status, or norepinephrine requirement.
- Echo evidence of hemodynamic compromise: RA systolic or RV diastolic collapse, plethoric IVC with minimal collapse, or rapidly enlarging effusion with clinical deterioration.
- Respiratory failure: need for **high-flow nasal cannula**, **noninvasive ventilation**, or impending intubation in suspected tamponade.
- High-risk pericarditis features: fever **>38°C**, large effusion, immunosuppression, trauma, anticoagulation, suspected purulent/TB/malignancy, or lack of improvement within **7 days**.
- Suspected constriction with decompensated right-sided failure plus renal/hepatic dysfunction (worsening creatinine, tense ascites) requiring aggressive diuresis or diagnostic hemodynamics.

## Orders to Place Now (3–6 bullets)
- Order: ECG 12-lead — {stat; repeat in 30–60 min if dynamic symptoms}
- Order: Transthoracic echocardiogram (limited/urgent) — {indication: suspected effusion/tamponade; notify cardiology}
- Order: Troponin I/T and CRP — {now; trend troponin q3–6h x2 if ACS/myopericarditis concern}
- Order: Ibuprofen PO — {dose 600–800 mg q8h with food; hold if AKI, active GI bleed, cirrhosis, severe HF}
- Order: Colchicine PO — {dose 0.6 mg BID if ≥70 kg or 0.6 mg daily if <70 kg; adjust/avoid in severe CKD or interacting meds}
- Order: Norepinephrine infusion — {start 0.05 mcg/kg/min; titrate to MAP ≥65 mmHg while arranging urgent drainage if tamponade}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1
### Stem
A 34-year-old man presents with sharp pleuritic chest pain that improves when leaning forward. He is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. ECG shows diffuse concave ST-segment elevations and PR depressions. Troponin is normal. Bedside echocardiogram shows a small pericardial effusion without chamber collapse. He has no immunosuppression and no recent trauma.
### Options
A. Start ibuprofen and colchicine and arrange outpatient follow-up if no high-risk features
B. Start prednisone as first-line therapy to rapidly reduce inflammation
C. Give IV heparin for presumed acute coronary syndrome
D. Initiate emergent pericardiocentesis
E. Begin broad-spectrum IV antibiotics for bacterial pericarditis
### Correct answer
A
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This presentation is classic for uncomplicated acute pericarditis without high-risk features; guideline-based first-line therapy is high-dose NSAID plus colchicine to reduce symptoms and recurrence, with activity restriction and follow-up (ESC 2015). Steroids increase recurrence risk when used first-line, and there is no evidence of ACS, tamponade, or purulent infection to justify heparin, drainage, or antibiotics.

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 71-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation on apixaban presents overnight with progressive dyspnea and lightheadedness. BP is 86/54 mmHg, HR 118/min, JVP is elevated, and heart sounds are distant. Bedside echo shows a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with right ventricular diastolic collapse and a plethoric IVC. She is cool and confused.
### Options
A. Give IV furosemide to reduce venous congestion and reassess
B. Start nitroglycerin infusion to reduce preload and afterload
C. Give a cautious IV fluid bolus and start norepinephrine while arranging urgent pericardial drainage
D. Start high-dose ibuprofen and colchicine for acute pericarditis and observe
E. Delay invasive management until anti–factor Xa level returns
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This is obstructive shock from tamponade; temporize with cautious fluids and vasopressor support while arranging emergent drainage, which is definitive (ESC 2015). The pitfall is worsening hemodynamics by reducing preload with diuretics or nitrates; anticoagulation heightens concern for hemorrhagic effusion, but drainage should not be delayed in unstable tamponade. What changed the decision here?
