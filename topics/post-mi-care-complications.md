# Post-MI care & complications

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If unstable (hypotension, altered mental status, ongoing chest pain, pulmonary edema): ABCs, monitor/defib pads, 2 IVs, stat ECG, point-of-care glucose, and call ICU/cardiology now; target **MAP ≥65 mmHg** and **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia suspected).
- For recurrent ischemic chest pain: **chew aspirin 162–325 mg** if not already given, give **nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL q5 min x3** only if **SBP ≥100 mmHg** and no RV infarct suspicion; add **morphine 2–4 mg IV** only if pain severe and refractory.
- For malignant arrhythmia: if pulseless VT/VF → immediate defibrillation + ACLS; if unstable monomorphic VT → synchronized cardioversion; correct **K⁺ ≥4.0 mmol/L** and **Mg²⁺ ≥2.0 mg/dL**.
- For bradycardia/AV block with hypoperfusion: **atropine 1 mg IV q3–5 min (max 3 mg)**, prepare transcutaneous pacing; avoid AV nodal blockers.
- Suspected mechanical complication (new harsh murmur, acute pulmonary edema, shock): treat as cardiogenic shock, avoid delays, urgent bedside echo; “Confirm Before Proceed” before nitrates/diuresis if RV infarct or severe MR suspected.

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float priority is distinguishing benign post-PCI discomfort vs recurrent ischemia: obtain repeat ECG within **10 minutes** of chest pain, compare to prior, trend high-sensitivity troponin only if clinical change, and assess for stent thrombosis (sudden pain, new ST changes, hemodynamic collapse) needing emergent cath activation. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** Default antithrombotic backbone after ACS is dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) unless bleeding risk prohibits: **aspirin + a P2Y12 inhibitor**; inpatient interruptions (NPO, procedures, bleeding) should trigger cardiology input because early discontinuation increases stent thrombosis risk. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** For ACS treated with PCI, P2Y12 choice generally favors ticagrelor or prasugrel over clopidogrel when not contraindicated; reconcile timing of last dose nightly, and ensure no duplication with anticoagulants (triple therapy bleeding risk). citeturn2search6
- **Guideline Must Know:** Beta-blocker is indicated early post-MI unless contraindicated (shock, bradycardia, high-grade AV block, acute decompensated HF); if starting/titrating overnight, use cautious dosing and hold for **HR <55/min** or **SBP <90–100 mmHg** or new congestion. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** High-intensity statin should be on board post-ACS (e.g., atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvastatin 20–40 mg); check for drug interactions and hepatic failure only if clinically indicated, not as routine nocturnal “statin labs.” citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** ACE inhibitor/ARB (or ARNI later) is particularly important with anterior MI, diabetes, hypertension, or **LVEF ≤40%**; start only when euvolemic and hemodynamically stable, and monitor for **creatinine rise >30%** or **K⁺ ≥5.5 mmol/L**. citeturn2search10
- **Guideline Must Know:** Post-MI patients with **LVEF ≤40%** plus HF symptoms or diabetes should receive an MRA (e.g., eplerenone/spironolactone) when **K⁺ <5.0 mmol/L** and **eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m²**; overnight, this is often “can wait” until morning unless discharge is imminent. citeturn2search10
- What must happen now when dyspnea develops: treat acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema with oxygen/ventilatory support, IV diuretics if volume overloaded, and vasopressors/inotropes if hypoperfused; get bedside echo to evaluate new LV dysfunction, severe MR, VSD, tamponade, or RV infarct.
- Rhythm surveillance: common early complications include accelerated idioventricular rhythm (often benign), atrial fibrillation (rate control vs cardioversion depends on stability), sustained VT/VF (requires immediate shock/antiarrhythmic), and bradyarrhythmias (inferior MI) requiring pacing support; correct electrolytes aggressively (**K⁺ ≥4.0**, **Mg²⁺ ≥2.0**).
- Conduction pitfalls: new bifascicular block, complete heart block, or alternating bundle branch block after MI suggests high risk of instability; avoid AV nodal blockers, prepare temporary pacing, and escalate early if symptomatic or if ventricular escape is slow (**HR <40/min**) or unstable.
- Mechanical complications (typically 2–7 days but can occur earlier): papillary muscle rupture (acute severe MR, pulmonary edema), VSD (new harsh murmur, shock), free wall rupture/tamponade (PEA/arrest, pericardial effusion); any suspected mechanical complication is an “echo now + cardiothoracic/cardiology now” event.
- RV infarct clue set: hypotension with clear lungs, elevated JVP, inferior MI pattern; treatment is preload optimization (small fluid boluses) and avoidance of nitrates/diuretics that can precipitate collapse; consider inotropes if persistent hypoperfusion.
- Pericarditis/post-MI inflammation: pleuritic pain relieved by leaning forward with diffuse ST changes suggests pericarditis; avoid routine NSAIDs early post-MI due to risk, and involve cardiology; ensure pain is not reinfarction or pulmonary embolism.
- Bleeding/antithrombotic complications: monitor for access-site hematoma, GI bleed, and intracranial symptoms; if life-threatening bleed occurs, “Confirm Before Proceed” with cardiology before stopping antiplatelets in recent PCI, and coordinate reversal strategy with the procedural team.
- What can wait until daytime (unless unstable): optimization of GDMT titration, lipid adjuncts, smoking cessation meds, cardiac rehab planning, ICD timing discussions (not in the first 40 days for primary prevention), and outpatient follow-up logistics; focus overnight on stability, recognizing complications, and preventing medication errors.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Persistent hypotension or hypoperfusion despite initial measures: **MAP <65 mmHg**, rising lactate, oliguria, or need for vasopressors/inotropes.
- Escalating respiratory support: **SpO₂ <90%** on ≥6 L/min nasal cannula, need for HFNC/NIV, or impending intubation due to pulmonary edema.
- Sustained VT/VF, recurrent defibrillation/cardioversion, new complete heart block with symptoms, or ventricular escape **HR <40/min**.
- Suspected mechanical complication: new loud murmur + shock/pulmonary edema, acute severe MR/VSD on exam, or tamponade physiology on bedside ultrasound.
- Recurrent ischemia with dynamic ST changes or concern for acute stent thrombosis (sudden chest pain + hemodynamic instability).

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 62-year-old man is 12 hours status post PCI with drug-eluting stent for anterior STEMI. He develops sudden severe chest pressure, diaphoresis, and nausea. BP is 88/54 mmHg, HR 110/min, SpO₂ 93% on 4 L/min. ECG shows new 2–3 mm ST elevation in the anterior leads compared with his post-PCI tracing. The cath report notes an uncomplicated procedure. What is the best next step?
### Options
A. Administer IV furosemide and obtain a routine troponin in 6 hours  
B. Give sublingual nitroglycerin and observe for symptom improvement  
C. Activate the cath lab emergently for suspected acute stent thrombosis  
D. Start ibuprofen for post-infarction pericarditis  
E. Order CT pulmonary angiography for possible pulmonary embolism
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Sudden recurrent ischemic chest pain with hemodynamic instability and new ST elevation soon after PCI is concerning for acute stent thrombosis and requires immediate reperfusion evaluation with emergent cath activation. citeturn2search1 Delaying for serial biomarkers or alternative imaging risks ongoing myocardial loss and death.

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 71-year-old woman is day 2 after inferior MI treated medically. She becomes acutely hypotensive (BP 78/46 mmHg) with clear lungs, cool extremities, and jugular venous distension. ECG shows sinus rhythm with inferior Q waves; bedside ultrasound suggests a dilated right ventricle without pericardial effusion. She received sublingual nitroglycerin 10 minutes ago for chest discomfort. What is the best immediate management?
### Options
A. Start nitroglycerin infusion and titrate to pain relief  
B. Give a cautious isotonic fluid bolus and reassess perfusion  
C. Give IV furosemide for presumed left-sided failure  
D. Administer IV metoprolol for heart rate control  
E. Start noninvasive ventilation for pulmonary edema
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This presentation fits right ventricular infarction physiology (hypotension, elevated JVP, clear lungs), where preload dependence makes nitrates dangerous; immediate therapy is cautious fluid resuscitation with close reassessment and escalation to inotropes/ICU if persistent shock. The pitfall is giving nitrates/diuretics in RV infarct–associated hypotension. What changed the decision here?

## Check Yourself Micro Questions (3–5 items)
- Q: In a post-MI patient with life-threatening hyperkalemia, what sequence should you follow first?
  A: Membrane stabilization with IV calcium, then intracellular shift (insulin/dextrose ± beta-agonist), then potassium removal (diuretics, binders, dialysis as appropriate).
- Q: What are the typical electrolyte targets overnight to reduce ventricular arrhythmia risk after MI?
  A: Maintain potassium at or above 4.0 mmol/L and magnesium at or above 2.0 mg/dL.
- Q: What bedside finding should trigger immediate concern for a mechanical post-MI complication?
  A: A new loud systolic murmur with acute pulmonary edema or shock should prompt urgent echocardiography and emergent cardiology/cardiothoracic evaluation.
- Q: What MAP target should you aim for in suspected cardiogenic shock while escalating care?
  A: Target a MAP of at least 65 mmHg while addressing perfusion and arranging ICU-level support.
