# Cardiomyopathies & myocarditis, Takotsubo

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- ABCs, monitor, IV access x2, bedside glucose; treat hypoxemia and keep **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or per COPD baseline), obtain STAT **12-lead ECG** and repeat with any change. citeturn3search14
- If hypotension/shock: confirm perfusion (mental status, urine output, lactate), start **norepinephrine** to **MAP ≥65 mmHg**; add inotrope only after bedside echo clarifies LVOT obstruction vs pump failure. citeturn3search19turn3search22
- Suspected myocarditis or Takotsubo can mimic ACS: treat as ACS until excluded (serial ECG/troponin, urgent cardiology for angiography when indicated). citeturn3search14turn3search19
- Malignant arrhythmia: defib/cardioversion per ACLS; correct **K⁺ ≥4.0 mmol/L**, **Mg²⁺ ≥2.0 mg/dL (0.8 mmol/L)**; avoid QT-prolongers if **QTc ≥500 ms**. citeturn3search14
- Pulmonary edema: upright, **noninvasive ventilation** if work of breathing, IV loop diuretic if volume overloaded; avoid aggressive diuresis/nitrates if echo suggests **dynamic LVOT obstruction**. citeturn3search22turn3search19

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float frame: decompensation usually presents as chest pain with troponin leak, acute HF/pulmonary edema, arrhythmia/syncope, or shock; your first job is to stabilize and sort into (1) ACS needing cath, (2) fulminant myocarditis needing ICU/MCS, or (3) Takotsubo physiology (often reversible but can shock). citeturn3search14turn3search19turn3search22
- **Guideline Must Know:** For suspected myocarditis, initial inpatient evaluation should include **ECG**, cardiac biomarkers (high-sensitivity troponin), inflammatory markers, and **transthoracic echocardiogram**; exclude obstructive CAD when clinically indicated because presentation can be indistinguishable from MI. citeturn3search14
- **Guideline Must Know:** Risk-triage myocarditis by instability: any **sustained VT/VF**, high-grade AV block, rapidly rising lactate, or need for escalating pressors = treat as possible **fulminant myocarditis** and move early to ICU/advanced HF-capable center. citeturn3search14
- **Guideline Must Know:** Bedside echo is a “night tool” that changes management immediately: look for **LVEF**, RV dysfunction, pericardial effusion/tamponade, and in suspected Takotsubo specifically assess for **dynamic LVOT obstruction** and apical thrombus. citeturn3search22turn3search19
- **Guideline Must Know:** Do not reflexively give inotropes in Takotsubo shock until LVOT obstruction is assessed; catecholamine-driven physiology can worsen obstruction and ischemia, so treat LVOT-obstructed shock with **fluids + beta-blockade + pure vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine or norepinephrine carefully)** rather than dobutamine. citeturn3search22turn3search19
- **Guideline Must Know:** Cardiac MRI is the preferred noninvasive confirmatory test for myocarditis when the patient is stable; endomyocardial biopsy is reserved for severe/fulminant presentations or when results would change therapy (e.g., suspected giant cell/eosinophilic/ICI myocarditis). citeturn3search14
- **Guideline Must Know:** Immunosuppression is not routine for suspected viral myocarditis; it is phenotype- and biopsy-driven in high-risk forms, so avoid overnight “steroids just in case” unless a specialist plan exists. Confirm Before Proceed: initiating high-dose steroids without a diagnostic strategy can obscure infection and alter biopsy yield. citeturn3search14
- Myocarditis practical bedside clues: recent viral prodrome, pleuritic or exertional chest pain, new HF, arrhythmias, or conduction disease; troponin can be high but non-diagnostic, and ECG may be nonspecific, so trend **troponin + ECG** and use echo to identify new systolic dysfunction. citeturn3search14
- Takotsubo practical bedside clues: post-menopausal predominance, intense emotional/physical trigger, ECG changes and troponin elevation out of proportion to coronary findings, and regional wall-motion patterns not confined to one epicardial territory; treat as ACS until angiography/clinical course supports Takotsubo. citeturn3search19turn3search22
- What must happen now (night shift): (1) stabilize oxygenation and perfusion, (2) serial ECG/troponin and urgent cardiology involvement if ACS cannot be excluded, (3) STAT echo if hypotension, pulmonary edema, new murmur, syncope, or rising lactate, and (4) continuous telemetry given arrhythmia risk in myocarditis/Takotsubo. citeturn3search14turn3search22
- What can wait (day team): etiologic cardiomyopathy workup and family/genetic considerations for nonischemic cardiomyopathies, including screening discussions and phenotyping, which ESC cardiomyopathy guidance emphasizes as part of comprehensive management rather than a night emergency task. citeturn3search25
- HCM/other cardiomyopathies at night: decompensation often relates to tachyarrhythmia, volume shifts, or afterload reduction; if obstructive physiology suspected, avoid vasodilators/overdiuresis and prefer **beta-blocker** for rate/gradient control while maintaining preload. citeturn3search12turn3search25
- Anticoagulation decisions: in Takotsubo with large akinetic apex or documented LV thrombus, anticoagulation is commonly used to prevent embolism; however, confirm bleeding risk and involve cardiology, and do not “auto-heparinize” if diagnosis unclear or invasive procedures are imminent. Confirm Before Proceed: starting therapeutic anticoagulation is hard to reverse quickly if cath/biopsy is planned. citeturn3search22turn3search14
- Arrhythmia pitfalls: myocarditis can cause VT/VF or AV block; treat per ACLS but anticipate recurrence, correct electrolytes aggressively, and escalate early for temporary pacing if high-grade block with instability. citeturn3search14
- ICU escalation pitfalls: “stable-looking” myocarditis can deteriorate abruptly; rising lactate, increasing ectopy, escalating oxygen/pressors, or worsening biventricular function on echo should prompt early advanced HF/cardiac ICU contact rather than serial ward-level tweaks. citeturn3search14

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Persistent hypotension requiring vasopressors or **lactate ≥2 mmol/L** with signs of hypoperfusion despite initial resuscitation. citeturn3search14
- Sustained VT/VF, recurrent defibrillation, or new high-grade AV block with syncope/hemodynamic compromise. citeturn3search14
- Acute pulmonary edema needing **noninvasive ventilation** or escalating oxygen beyond **≥6 L/min** nasal cannula (or any impending intubation). citeturn3search22
- Echo showing severe LV dysfunction, RV failure, tamponade physiology, or suspected Takotsubo with **dynamic LVOT obstruction** plus hypotension. citeturn3search22turn3search19
- Concern for myocarditis phenotype requiring biopsy-directed therapy (fulminant course, ventricular arrhythmias, or suspected immune-mediated myocarditis such as ICI exposure). citeturn3search14

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 28-year-old man presents with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea after a viral upper respiratory illness. ECG shows diffuse ST-segment changes without a clear coronary territory. High-sensitivity troponin is elevated. He is hemodynamically stable but tachycardic. Bedside echo shows mildly reduced LVEF without pericardial tamponade. Which is the most appropriate next step in management tonight?
### Options
A. Start high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone immediately for presumed myocarditis  
B. Treat as possible acute coronary syndrome while arranging urgent cardiology evaluation to exclude obstructive coronary disease and obtain confirmatory testing (e.g., cardiac MRI when stable)  
C. Discharge with NSAIDs and outpatient cardiology follow-up because myocarditis is usually self-limited  
D. Start dobutamine infusion to improve myocardial inflammation-related dysfunction  
E. Begin thrombolysis for presumed STEMI based on ST-segment changes  
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Suspected myocarditis can clinically mimic acute coronary syndrome, so obstructive coronary disease should be excluded when indicated while completing initial myocarditis evaluation (ECG, biomarkers, echo) and planning confirmatory testing such as cardiac MRI in stable patients. citeturn3search14 High-dose steroids are not routine without a phenotype/biopsy-driven indication, and thrombolysis is inappropriate without a STEMI pattern and confirmation. citeturn3search14

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 67-year-old woman develops acute chest pain and dyspnea after a major emotional stressor. ECG shows anterior T-wave inversions and troponin is mildly elevated. Coronary angiography earlier today showed no obstructive disease. Overnight she becomes hypotensive (BP 78/46 mmHg) with cool extremities. Bedside echo shows apical akinesis with hyperdynamic basal segments and a dynamic LV outflow tract gradient consistent with LVOT obstruction. What is the best immediate hemodynamic strategy?
### Options
A. Start dobutamine to improve cardiac output  
B. Give intravenous nitroglycerin and increase diuretics to reduce filling pressures  
C. Give cautious intravenous fluids and start a beta-blocker; use a pure vasoconstrictor for blood pressure support if needed  
D. Start an intra-aortic balloon pump as first-line therapy without medical optimization  
E. Start high-dose intravenous steroids for stress cardiomyopathy  
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
The pitfall is dynamic LVOT obstruction in Takotsubo shock, where inotropes and afterload reduction can worsen obstruction and hypotension. citeturn3search22turn3search19 Immediate management prioritizes preload support (cautious fluids), rate/contractility control (beta-blocker), and vasoconstriction to maintain perfusion. citeturn3search22
