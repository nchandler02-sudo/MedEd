# ASCVD risk assessment & primary prevention

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If “prevention” consult is actually acute ischemia: treat as ACS until proven otherwise—place on monitor, obtain **12‑lead ECG within 10 minutes**, draw **high‑sensitivity troponin now and repeat per protocol**, give **chewable aspirin 325 mg** unless true allergy/active bleeding. citeturn2search1
- Stabilize first: airway/oxygen/IV access; target **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia risk), treat hypotension with fluids/pressors to **MAP ≥65 mmHg** while evaluating cause. citeturn2search1
- Rule out hypertensive emergency before “routine risk counseling”: if **SBP ≥180 or DBP ≥120** plus end‑organ injury (neuro deficits, pulmonary edema, AKI, ischemic ECG changes), escalate and treat urgently rather than starting elective preventive meds. citeturn2search1
- Confirm Before Proceed: do not newly start aspirin/statin for “primary prevention” until you’ve clarified (1) no active bleeding/major liver injury, (2) pregnancy potential, (3) true secondary prevention indications (prior MI/stroke/PAD) that change urgency and intensity. citeturn2search1turn2search8

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- **Now (night‑float reality):** prevention questions usually arise from med‑reconciliation, incidental labs, or discharge planning—first confirm there is no active ACS/stroke/critical limb ischemia, and verify the patient is not already “secondary prevention” (known ASCVD) because that changes intensity/targets and consult needs. citeturn2search1turn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** for adults **40–75 years**, estimate 10‑year ASCVD risk using the ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations (PCE) to anchor shared decision‑making; risk estimates are guides, not absolutes, and can overestimate in some groups. citeturn2search28turn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** categorize 10‑year risk to structure decisions: **low <5%**, **borderline 5%–<7.5%**, **intermediate ≥7.5%–<20%**, **high ≥20%**; intensity of therapy generally increases with risk category and risk enhancers. citeturn2search1turn2search16
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** “statin benefit groups” in primary prevention include: (1) **LDL‑C ≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L)**, (2) diabetes age **40–75** with LDL‑C **70–189 mg/dL**, and (3) age **40–75** with LDL‑C **70–189 mg/dL** plus elevated 10‑year risk; these groups should trigger a statin discussion even during inpatient stays. citeturn2search16turn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** **LDL‑C ≥190 mg/dL**: start **high‑intensity statin** (goal **≥50% LDL reduction**) and evaluate for familial hypercholesterolemia/secondary causes; if LDL remains markedly elevated on maximally tolerated statin, consider adding nonstatin therapy with outpatient follow‑up. citeturn2search16turn2search21
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** diabetes age **40–75**: at least **moderate‑intensity statin**; consider **high‑intensity** if multiple risk factors or higher risk (e.g., long duration, CKD, smoking) and align with patient values at discharge. citeturn2search16turn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** for intermediate risk (**≥7.5%–<20%**), moderate‑intensity statin is typical; aim for **≥30% LDL reduction** (and **≥50%** if high risk or strong risk enhancers) while emphasizing lifestyle as foundation. citeturn2search16turn2search1
- **Guideline Must‑Know:** USPSTF frames statins as: initiate for adults **40–75** with ≥1 risk factor and **10‑year risk ≥10%**; selectively offer if **7.5%–<10%**; evidence is insufficient to start at **≥76 years**—use as a cross‑check when you are uncertain overnight. citeturn2search28
- Risk enhancers that push toward statins when borderline/intermediate include: **family history of premature ASCVD**, **persistently elevated LDL‑C ≥160 mg/dL**, **CKD (eGFR 15–59)**, **metabolic syndrome**, **inflammatory disease** (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis), **persistently elevated triglycerides ≥175 mg/dL**, and measured biomarkers (e.g., **Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL or ≥125 nmol/L**, **apoB >130 mg/dL**, **hs‑CRP ≥2 mg/L**, **ABI <0.9**). citeturn2search25turn2search16
- Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a tie‑breaker when risk is uncertain: **CAC = 0** can justify deferring statin in many intermediate‑risk adults, but exceptions include **smoking**, **diabetes**, or strong family history; **CAC ≥100** or ≥75th percentile strongly favors statin. citeturn2search1turn2search16
- Statin intensities (use generics, verify interactions): high‑intensity options include **atorvastatin 40–80 mg nightly** or **rosuvastatin 20–40 mg nightly**; moderate‑intensity includes **atorvastatin 10–20 mg**, **rosuvastatin 5–10 mg**, **simvastatin 20–40 mg**, **pravastatin 40–80 mg**, **lovastatin 40 mg**—document planned follow‑up lipids **4–12 weeks** after initiation/adjustment. citeturn2search16
- Aspirin is rarely “routine” primary prevention now: USPSTF recommends individualized decision for adults **40–59** with **≥10%** 10‑year risk and low bleeding risk, and recommends **against initiating** aspirin for primary prevention in adults **≥60**; if the patient is inpatient with anemia/ulcer/anticoagulation, default to no new aspirin overnight. citeturn2search8turn2search1
- What can wait until daytime/outpatient: CAC ordering, advanced lipids (Lp(a), apoB) if not urgent, and nonstatin escalation (ezetimibe/PCSK9/bempedoic acid) unless LDL is extreme or there is suspected familial hypercholesterolemia; ensure a concrete follow‑up plan rather than “discuss with PCP.” citeturn2search21turn2search16
- Pitfalls on nights: acute illness can transiently lower LDL (a “normal” inpatient LDL may understate baseline); starting statins in active severe hepatitis or after unexplained rhabdomyolysis requires caution; check for strong CYP3A4 inhibitor co‑meds if choosing simvastatin/lovastatin, and document contraindications/plan if you defer. citeturn2search16
- Special risk contexts to auto‑flag: pregnancy potential (avoid statins), **severe CKD/ESRD** (higher myopathy risk and complex benefit discussion), cirrhosis/active hepatic injury (defer until clarified), high QT risk (avoid interacting agents if adding smoking cessation meds), and active GI bleed (avoid aspirin). citeturn2search8turn2search16
- When to involve others: cardiology/lipidology for suspected familial hypercholesterolemia (very high LDL plus family history/xanthomas), pharmacy for interaction checks and discharge access, and primary team/PCP coordination for shared decision documentation (risk, benefit, patient preference). citeturn2search16turn2search21

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- New chest pain/ischemic equivalents with **dynamic ECG changes** or rising troponin pattern (treat as ACS; consult cardiology urgently). citeturn2search1
- **SBP ≥180 or DBP ≥120** with objective end‑organ injury (encephalopathy, pulmonary edema, AKI, ischemic ECG changes) requiring emergent BP management and higher level of care. citeturn2search1
- Suspected familial hypercholesterolemia or extreme dyslipidemia: **LDL‑C ≥190 mg/dL** plus premature ASCVD in first‑degree relative or tendon xanthomas (consider lipid specialist/cardiology referral plan). citeturn2search16
- Active bleeding/high bleeding risk with a request to start aspirin for “prevention” (involve attending/pharmacy; do not initiate without daytime shared decision). citeturn2search8

## Orders to Place Now (3–6 bullets)
- Order: Lipid panel (fasting preferred if feasible) — {timing; fasting yes/no; reason: risk stratification/med reconciliation}
- Order: Hemoglobin A1c — {if unknown in last 3 months; diabetes screening/risk enhancer}
- Order: Comprehensive metabolic panel — {baseline AST/ALT; creatinine/eGFR; before statin initiation/secondary causes}
- Order: Urine albumin/creatinine ratio — {if diabetes/HTN; CKD risk enhancer; outpatient follow-up if inpatient not feasible}
- Order: Lipoprotein(a) — {one-time measurement if family history premature ASCVD or unexplained high risk; outpatient if needed}

## ABIM‑Style Question 1
### Stem
A 56-year-old man is admitted for cellulitis. He has no history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral artery disease. He smokes 1 pack per day, has treated hypertension, and his fasting lipid panel shows total cholesterol 220 mg/dL, HDL-C 42 mg/dL, LDL-C 148 mg/dL, triglycerides 160 mg/dL. His calculated 10-year ASCVD risk is 14%. He asks what you recommend for preventing a first heart attack.
### Options
- A. Begin high-intensity statin therapy to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction
- B. Begin moderate-intensity statin therapy and reinforce lifestyle changes
- C. Begin low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily for primary prevention
- D. Defer pharmacotherapy because his LDL-C is below 190 mg/dL
- E. Start ezetimibe monotherapy
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
For adults 40–75 years with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL and intermediate 10-year risk (**≥7.5%–<20%**), guidelines support initiating a **moderate-intensity statin** with a goal of **≥30% LDL-C reduction** as part of shared decision-making. citeturn2search16turn2search1 Aspirin is not routinely recommended for primary prevention and should be used infrequently, with USPSTF advising individualized use only in select 40–59-year-olds with **≥10%** risk and low bleeding risk. citeturn2search8turn2search1

## Second ABIM‑Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 52-year-old woman hospitalized for pyelonephritis has LDL-C 132 mg/dL, HDL-C 50 mg/dL, and a 10-year ASCVD risk estimate of 8%. She is a nonsmoker and does not have diabetes. Her father had an MI at age 49. She strongly prefers to avoid long-term medication unless benefit is clear. An outpatient coronary artery calcium score obtained last month is 0.
### Options
- A. Start high-intensity statin therapy now
- B. Start moderate-intensity statin therapy now
- C. Defer statin therapy for now and focus on lifestyle, with reassessment after recovery
- D. Start low-dose aspirin 81 mg daily
- E. Start ezetimibe monotherapy
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
In borderline to intermediate risk adults with uncertainty, CAC can refine decisions: **CAC = 0** can justify deferring statin therapy, especially when bleeding/side-effect concerns or strong preferences exist, while emphasizing lifestyle and follow-up. citeturn2search1turn2search16 The pitfall is assuming family history alone mandates immediate statin despite a **CAC = 0** result; exceptions where CAC=0 should not defer include diabetes or current smoking, which she lacks. citeturn2search16
