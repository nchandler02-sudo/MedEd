# Acute coronary syndromes (STEMI/NSTEMI/UA)

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)

- ABCs, monitor/defib pads, 2 IVs; get 12‑lead ECG **within 10 min** and repeat with ongoing pain; check glucose. citeturn2search2turn2search18
- Give **aspirin 162–325 mg chew** ASAP (unless true anaphylaxis/active life-threatening bleeding). citeturn2search2
- Oxygen only if **SpO₂ <90%** or respiratory distress; target **SpO₂ 90–94%** (avoid routine oxygen). citeturn2search2turn2search18
- If ongoing ischemic pain and SBP adequate: **nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL q5 min x3** (avoid if **SBP <90**, suspected RV infarct, severe aortic stenosis, or **PDE5 inhibitor within 24–48 h**). citeturn2search2turn2search18
- If STEMI/new STEMI equivalent: activate cath lab now; goal **primary PCI ≤90 min (door-to-device)** or **≤120 min if transfer**; if not feasible and symptom onset **≤12 h**, consider fibrinolysis **(door-to-needle ≤30 min)**. Confirm Before Proceed: rule out absolute lytic contraindications. citeturn2search2turn2search18
- Start anticoagulation and P2Y12 once strategy is clear; call cardiology early, and escalate to ICU for shock, hypoxemia, malignant arrhythmia, or persistent ischemia. citeturn2search2

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)

- Treat “ACS” as time-sensitive myocardial ischemia until proven otherwise: obtain serial ECGs with any change in symptoms, and use high-sensitivity troponin with delta-based interpretation to distinguish acute MI vs chronic injury; remember unstable angina exists but is less common with hs‑troponin assays. citeturn2search2turn2search36turn2search30
- **Guideline Must Know:** Do not delay reperfusion therapy in STEMI while “waiting for troponin”; ECG criteria drive immediate cath lab activation and reperfusion decisions. citeturn2search2turn2search18
- **Guideline Must Know:** Primary PCI is preferred when achievable within **≤90 min** at PCI-capable centers (or **≤120 min** with interfacility transfer); if these targets cannot be met and symptoms began **≤12 h**, fibrinolysis is recommended if no contraindications. citeturn2search2turn2search18
- **Guideline Must Know:** Give **aspirin 162–325 mg** immediately, then continue daily maintenance dosing; aspirin is foundational across STEMI/NSTE-ACS unless contraindicated. citeturn2search2
- **Guideline Must Know:** Oxygen is not routine; give only for **SpO₂ <90%**, respiratory distress, or high-risk hypoxemia, and titrate rather than “nonrebreather by default.” citeturn2search2turn2search18
- **Guideline Must Know:** Start parenteral anticoagulation for confirmed/suspected NSTE-ACS or STEMI (agent depends on strategy and renal function), and reassess bleeding risk frequently on night float (recent procedures, anemia, cirrhosis, CKD). citeturn2search2
- **Guideline Must Know:** Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is default after ACS; after PCI, ticagrelor or prasugrel is generally preferred over clopidogrel when not contraindicated; plan duration and de-escalation based on bleeding risk and need for anticoagulation. citeturn2search2turn2search21
- **Guideline Must Know:** Avoid upstream P2Y12 in NSTE-ACS when urgent CABG is likely or anatomy unknown and bleeding risk is high; coordinate with cardiology on timing when angiography is planned early. citeturn2search2
- Separate STEMI vs NSTE-ACS quickly: STEMI requires immediate reperfusion pathway; NSTE-ACS management hinges on risk (ongoing pain, dynamic ST changes, ventricular arrhythmias, HF, hemodynamic instability, rising troponin) and early invasive strategy for higher-risk patients during hospitalization. citeturn2search2turn2search7
- Night float pitfall: “troponin-positive ≠ type 1 MI.” Use the universal definition—acute myocardial injury requires a rise/fall with at least one value above the **99th percentile**, and MI requires evidence of ischemia (symptoms/ECG/imaging/thrombus); treat type 2 MI by fixing supply–demand mismatch, not reflex cath/heparin in every case. citeturn2search30turn2search2
- Symptom control that does not sabotage outcomes: use nitroglycerin if appropriate; avoid hypotension; opioids can obscure symptoms and may delay absorption of oral antiplatelets—reserve for refractory pain with careful monitoring. citeturn2search2
- Think “STEMI equivalents” at night: posterior MI (ST depression V1–V3 with tall R waves; confirm with posterior leads), new ischemic LBBB with strong clinical suspicion, or persistent ischemic symptoms with concerning ECG changes—activate pathways rather than “watch and wait.” citeturn2search2
- High-risk contexts to auto-flag on call: active GI bleed/anticoagulation (coordinate antithrombotics), severe CKD/ESRD (drug selection/dosing, contrast risk discussion), pregnancy (avoid ACE inhibitors/statins; cardiology/MFM), QT-prolonging meds/electrolytes if starting antiarrhythmics, and cocaine/amphetamine use (avoid pure beta-blocker monotherapy; treat hypertension/vasospasm). citeturn2search2turn2search7
- “What must happen now” vs “what can wait”: now—ECG/telemetry, aspirin, activate cath pathway for STEMI, treat arrhythmias/shock, anticoagulation/DAPT per strategy, correct hypoxemia; can wait until daylight—formal echo (if stable), lipid/diabetes optimization, rehab counseling, and long-term antithrombotic fine-tuning. citeturn2search2turn2search21
- When to call ICU/cardiology immediately: persistent ischemic pain despite nitrates, dynamic ECG changes, sustained VT/VF, new pulmonary edema, hypotension, high oxygen requirement, or suspected mechanical complication (new harsh murmur, acute MR, VSD, tamponade physiology). citeturn2search2turn2search7
- Revascularization planning matters even overnight: multivessel disease decisions (culprit-only vs complete revascularization; PCI vs CABG) are “heart team” issues, but you should flag left main suspicion, cardiogenic shock, and ongoing ischemia early because they change timing and destination. citeturn2search25turn2search2

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)

- Hemodynamic instability: **SBP <90 mmHg**, rising lactate, need for vasopressors, or suspected cardiogenic shock (cool extremities, oliguria, altered mental status). citeturn2search2
- Respiratory failure: **SpO₂ <90%** despite escalating oxygen, need for noninvasive ventilation, intubation, or acute pulmonary edema. citeturn2search2
- Electrical instability: sustained VT/VF, recurrent polymorphic VT, symptomatic bradycardia/heart block requiring pacing, or recurrent ICD shocks. citeturn2search2
- Refractory ischemia or high-risk ECG: ongoing chest pain with dynamic ST changes, posterior STEMI pattern, or new ischemic conduction abnormality; activate interventional cardiology emergently. citeturn2search2turn2search7
- Suspected mechanical complication: acute MR/VSD/free wall rupture signs (sudden pulmonary edema, new loud murmur, rapid shock) or pericardial tamponade physiology. citeturn2search7turn2search2

## ABIM Style Question 1

### Stem

A 58-year-old man with hypertension presents with 60 minutes of crushing substernal chest pain and diaphoresis. ECG shows 2 mm ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in I and aVL. Blood pressure is 128/76 mmHg, oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Your hospital is PCI-capable and the cath team can be ready within 30 minutes. What is the best next step?

### Options

A. Obtain serial high-sensitivity troponins before activating the cath lab  
B. Administer aspirin and activate the cath lab for immediate primary PCI  
C. Administer fibrinolytic therapy immediately because symptom onset is <2 hours  
D. Start a heparin infusion and schedule angiography for the morning  
E. Order a CT angiogram of the chest to exclude aortic dissection before any therapy  

### Correct answer

B

### Rationale (2–4 sentences)

ST-elevation MI requires immediate reperfusion based on the ECG; primary PCI is preferred when it can be performed promptly (goal **≤90 min door-to-device** at PCI-capable centers). citeturn2search2turn2search18 Aspirin should be given immediately, and cath lab activation should not wait for troponin confirmation. citeturn2search2 Fibrinolysis is reserved for situations where timely PCI cannot be achieved and no contraindications exist. citeturn2search2turn2search18

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem

A 66-year-old man presents with inferior STEMI and ongoing chest pain. He is pale and diaphoretic with blood pressure 84/58 mmHg, heart rate 52/min, clear lungs, and jugular venous distension. ECG shows ST elevation in II, III, and aVF. Which immediate therapy is most appropriate while activating emergent reperfusion?

### Options

A. Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg now  
B. 500–1000 mL isotonic crystalloid bolus and avoid nitrates pending right-sided ECG  
C. IV furosemide 40 mg now  
D. Metoprolol IV 5 mg now  
E. Morphine IV 4 mg now as first-line therapy  

### Correct answer

B

### Rationale (2–4 sentences)

This presentation suggests right ventricular infarction with preload dependence (hypotension, JVD, clear lungs); nitrates can precipitate profound hypotension, so initial management is cautious volume resuscitation and rapid reperfusion activation. citeturn2search2turn2search7 The pitfall is giving vasodilators (nitroglycerin) before recognizing RV involvement; obtain right-sided leads and support perfusion. citeturn2search2 What changed the decision here?

## Check Yourself Micro Questions (3–5 items)

- Q: In suspected ACS, what is the target time to obtain and interpret the first 12‑lead ECG?  
  A: **Within 10 minutes** of first medical contact/arrival. citeturn2search2turn2search18
- Q: What SpO₂ threshold supports giving supplemental oxygen in ACS (routine oxygen is not recommended)?  
  A: Give oxygen if **SpO₂ <90%** or there is respiratory distress/hypoxemia. citeturn2search2turn2search18
- Q: For fibrinolysis-eligible STEMI when PCI delays are excessive, what is the symptom-onset window commonly used for benefit?  
  A: Consider fibrinolysis when symptom onset is **≤12 hours** and timely PCI is not achievable. citeturn2search2turn2search18

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight (3–5 bullets; NO prose)

- Acute coronary syndrome, specify type: STEMI vs NSTEMI vs unstable angina; suspected culprit territory; objective evidence (ECG changes, troponin trend with delta, symptoms timing); treatment initiated (aspirin/DAPT/anticoagulation/reperfusion activation)
- Myocardial infarction type: type 1 vs type 2 vs myocardial injury; trigger for type 2 (sepsis/anemia/tachyarrhythmia/hypoxemia/hypotension); objective ischemia evidence; management focused on cause and cardiac risk
- Hemodynamic status: cardiogenic shock vs hypotension without shock; organ dysfunction criteria (lactate, urine output, creatinine, mental status); pressors/fluids started; ICU transfer rationale
- Acute heart failure/pulmonary edema due to ACS: oxygen requirement/ventilatory support, CXR/POCUS/BNP if used, exam findings, diuresis/vasodilator decisions and contraindications
- Bleeding risk/contraindications impacting therapy: active bleeding, recent stroke/surgery, anticoagulant use, severe thrombocytopenia; how this changed antithrombotic/lytic decisions and monitoring plan
