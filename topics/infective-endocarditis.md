# Infective endocarditis

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If unstable: airway/breathing support, large-bore IVs, **MAP ≥65 mmHg** (balanced crystalloids, then **norepinephrine first-line**), continuous telemetry, strict I/Os, and urgent ICU consult.
- Draw blood cultures before antibiotics if feasible: **≥3 sets** from separate venipunctures (do not delay antibiotics if septic shock).
- Start empiric IV antibiotics after cultures: **vancomycin 15–20 mg/kg IV q8–12 h (AUC/MIC 400–600 or trough 15–20 mg/L)** + **cefepime 2 g IV q8 h** (renal adjust); broaden/alter per prosthetic valve/CIED, IVDU, healthcare exposure.
- Get imaging now: STAT **TTE**; if negative/inadequate or prosthetic/CIED/high suspicion, order **TEE** (repeat **in 3–5 days** if still high suspicion and initial TEE negative).
- Screen for catastrophic complications: new HF/flash pulmonary edema, conduction block, embolic stroke, splenic/renal infarct, spinal epidural abscess; treat pain/neurologic change as embolic/infectious emergency.
- Confirm Before Proceed: suspected IE + acute ischemic stroke is a high hemorrhage-risk scenario—avoid irreversible thrombolysis decisions without urgent neurology input and imaging; prioritize reperfusion strategy review (e.g., thrombectomy evaluation if large vessel occlusion).

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Infective endocarditis (IE) is a time-critical inpatient diagnosis: bacteremia + endocardial/valvular infection that can decompensate overnight via **acute valvular regurgitation → pulmonary edema/shock**, conduction disease from periannular extension, and embolic phenomena (CNS, spleen, kidney, lung in right-sided IE).
- **Guideline Must Know:** Diagnostic classification now commonly uses **2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria**, which broaden “major” imaging/microbiology (including cardiac CT and **FDG-PET/CT** in appropriate contexts) and remove strict timing intervals between culture draws (but still require independently drawn cultures).
- **Guideline Must Know:** Microbiology first: obtain **≥3 blood-culture sets** (aerobic/anaerobic) from separate venipunctures before antibiotics when clinically safe; if already on antibiotics or unstable, draw cultures immediately and start therapy without delay.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Echocardiography sequence: do **TTE expeditiously** for all suspected IE; do **TEE** if TTE negative/inadequate but suspicion remains, if prosthetic valve/CIED, or to assess complications; if TEE negative but suspicion remains, **repeat TEE in 3–5 days**.
- Night-float “must happen now” actions: assess hemodynamics, oxygenation, and new murmurs; check for embolic neuro deficits; review lines/devices/prosthetic valves; get baseline ECG (look for **new PR prolongation/AV block**) and call cardiology/cardiac surgery early if conduction changes suggest abscess.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Empiric antibiotics depend on valve type and risk: for many ill adults with unknown organism, **vancomycin + broad Gram-negative coverage (e.g., cefepime)** is a common bridge after cultures while awaiting speciation/susceptibilities; avoid narrow therapy until culture data unless classic low-risk streptococcal scenario is clear.
- “What can wait until daylight” (if stable): definitive organism-directed regimen, OPAT planning, dental source evaluation, and nonurgent imaging for metastatic infection—but only after stabilization, cultures, and echo plan are in motion.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Culture-negative IE is often iatrogenic (prior antibiotics) or due to fastidious organisms; document any recent antibiotics, order serology/PCR workup when indicated (e.g., Coxiella, Bartonella) and involve ID early because empiric regimens and diagnostics diverge.
- Right-sided IE (often IVDU) commonly causes septic pulmonary emboli: sudden pleuritic pain, hemoptysis, hypoxemia; manage as IE (cultures, antibiotics, echo) plus supportive respiratory care—don’t anchor on “pneumonia” if blood cultures positive and there are peripheral stigmata.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Surgical/early procedural thinking is not “later”: the big three indications are **heart failure from valve dysfunction**, **uncontrolled infection** (abscess, fistula, persistent bacteremia/fever despite appropriate therapy), and **embolism prevention** when vegetations are large or emboli recur; early heart team/endocarditis team involvement improves timeliness of decisions.
- Embolic stroke at night: treat as neurologic emergency and assume higher hemorrhage risk; prioritize CT/CTA and neurology consult; maintain perfusion, avoid hypotension, and coordinate antibiotic timing after cultures. Do not reflexively anticoagulate for “stroke prevention” in IE.
- Pitfalls: starting antibiotics before cultures in stable patients (reduces yield), assuming a single negative TTE excludes IE, missing prosthetic/CIED IE (often needs TEE/advanced imaging), under-recognizing periannular abscess (new conduction delay), and continuing anticoagulation without reassessing bleeding/ICH risk after CNS events.
- Renal/ototoxicity risk is high: vancomycin and aminoglycosides require careful dosing/monitoring; in CKD, prefer regimens that avoid aminoglycosides when acceptable (coordinate with ID/pharmacy).
- Device/line management: if CIED infection or persistent bacteremia with no alternative source, anticipate that **device/lead removal** may be required; for suspected catheter source, remove/replace per line-infection principles while maintaining access for resuscitation/antibiotics.
- Disposition mindset: if any instability, conduction disease, suspected abscess, severe regurgitation/HF, CNS event, or prosthetic/CIED involvement, treat as high-risk IE and escalate early (ICU, cardiology, cardiac surgery, neurology, and ID as appropriate).

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Hemodynamic instability: **MAP <65 mmHg** after fluids or any vasopressor requirement, rising lactate, or rapidly increasing oxygen/ventilatory support.
- Acute valve failure/HF: new pulmonary edema, need for NIPPV/intubation, or echo showing severe acute regurgitation or tamponade physiology.
- Conduction/extension: **new 2nd/3rd degree AV block**, new bundle branch block with sepsis, or imaging concern for abscess/fistula/dehiscence.
- Neurologic catastrophe: new focal deficit, seizure, altered mental status, suspected intracranial hemorrhage, or large vessel occlusion on CTA.
- Persistent bacteremia/fever: positive cultures beyond **48–72 h** on appropriate therapy or any suspicion of prosthetic/CIED IE requiring procedural planning.

## Orders to Place Now (3–6 bullets)
- Order: Blood cultures x3 sets (aerobic/anaerobic) — {sites: separate venipunctures; timing: now; note: before antibiotics if stable}
- Order: CBC with differential, CMP, lactate, coagulation panel, ESR/CRP — {frequency: now; repeat: lactate q{2-4}h if septic}
- Order: Vancomycin IV — {weight_kg}; {renal_function}; {dosing_strategy: AUC 400–600 or trough 15–20 mg/L}; {first_dose_time}
- Order: Cefepime IV — {renal_function}; {dose: 2 g}; {interval: q8h}; {beta_lactam_allergy: yes/no}
- Order: Transthoracic echocardiogram (STAT) — {indication: suspected IE; include: valve function, vegetations, regurg severity}
- Order: Transesophageal echocardiogram — {timing: urgent if prosthetic/CIED/high suspicion or TTE nondiagnostic}; {NPO_status}; {anticoag_status}

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 54-year-old man is admitted overnight with 2 days of fever and chills. He has a new holosystolic murmur at the apex, several splinter hemorrhages, and no focal neurologic deficits. Blood pressure is 128/74 mmHg, heart rate 102/min, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. He has not received antibiotics. Infective endocarditis is strongly suspected, and he is hemodynamically stable. What is the most appropriate next step?
### Options
A. Start vancomycin immediately and obtain blood cultures afterward  
B. Obtain ≥3 sets of blood cultures from separate venipunctures, then start empiric IV antibiotics  
C. Delay all antibiotics until transesophageal echocardiography confirms vegetations  
D. Start oral amoxicillin-clavulanate and reassess in the morning  
E. Give a single dose of gentamicin while awaiting culture results
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
In stable suspected IE, obtain **multiple blood-culture sets (typically ≥3)** from separate venipunctures before starting antibiotics to maximize microbiologic diagnosis and enable targeted therapy. Empiric IV antibiotics should follow promptly after cultures and should not be delayed for imaging confirmation. Starting antibiotics before cultures (A) reduces yield; delaying antibiotics until TEE (C) risks progression in a high-mortality infection.

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 63-year-old woman with fever, a new diastolic murmur, and positive peripheral stigmata concerning for infective endocarditis suddenly develops right-sided weakness and aphasia 90 minutes after last known well. Noncontrast head CT shows no hemorrhage. The stroke team asks whether to administer IV alteplase. What is the best next step?
### Options
A. Administer IV alteplase immediately because CT shows no hemorrhage  
B. Administer IV heparin bolus to prevent further septic emboli  
C. Defer thrombolysis, obtain CTA head/neck, and pursue urgent thrombectomy evaluation if large vessel occlusion while initiating IE workup and antibiotics after cultures  
D. Give aspirin and delay all further evaluation until morning rounds  
E. Start high-dose corticosteroids to reduce cerebral edema before any vascular imaging
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Suspected IE is a high-risk context for intracranial hemorrhage, and thrombolysis can be harmful; the pitfall is treating this as routine ischemic stroke without accounting for septic embolic biology and hemorrhagic transformation risk. The best approach is urgent vascular imaging and thrombectomy evaluation when indicated, alongside immediate IE management (cultures, antibiotics, echo, and specialty consultation). Heparin (B) is not a reflex substitute and may increase bleeding risk without addressing the source.  
What changed the decision here?
