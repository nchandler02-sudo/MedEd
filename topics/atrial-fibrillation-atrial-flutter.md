# Atrial fibrillation & atrial flutter

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- Assess stability first: hypotension, ischemic chest pain, pulmonary edema, altered mental status, shock; if unstable tachycardia due to AF/AFL → **synchronized cardioversion 200 J biphasic** (sedate if feasible but do not delay). citeturn2search13
- If stable with RVR: ABCs, O₂ to **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or patient-specific), IV access, cardiac monitor/defib pads, obtain **12‑lead ECG** and check K⁺/Mg²⁺; treat triggers (pain, fever, hypovolemia, sepsis, hypoxia). citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Rate control (choose based on EF/BP): metoprolol **5 mg IV q5 min ×3** (max **15 mg**) OR diltiazem **0.25 mg/kg IV**, repeat **0.35 mg/kg** then infusion **5–15 mg/h** (avoid if suspected HFrEF/decomp HF). citeturn2search11turn2search1
- If decompensated HF/hypotension limits AV‑nodal blockers: consider **amiodarone 150 mg IV over 10 min**, then **1 mg/min ×6 h** then **0.5 mg/min**; call ICU/cardiology early. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Confirm Before Proceed: if AF duration **>48 h or unknown**, elective cardioversion requires **≥3 weeks therapeutic anticoagulation** or **TEE-guided** strategy; continue anticoagulation **≥4 weeks after** cardioversion. citeturn2search11turn2search1turn2search23
- Red flag rhythm: irregular wide‑complex tachycardia with possible pre‑excitation (WPW) → avoid AV‑nodal blockers (diltiazem/verapamil, beta‑blockers, digoxin, adenosine); if unstable → immediate cardioversion; if stable → procainamide/ibutilide and consult cardiology. citeturn2search11turn2search1

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- AF (irregularly irregular) and typical atrial flutter (often sawtooth, commonly **~150 bpm** ventricular rate with 2:1 block) are common night calls because triggers cluster overnight: hypoxia, sepsis, alcohol withdrawal, PE, ACS, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte depletion, and missed rate-control meds; treating the precipitant can convert “RVR” into sinus without escalating antiarrhythmics. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** Management begins with hemodynamic assessment; **unstable** AF/AFL (shock, ischemia, acute pulmonary edema, AMS clearly from tachycardia) warrants **immediate synchronized cardioversion** rather than prolonged drug trials, and sedation is secondary to restoring perfusion. citeturn2search13turn2search11
- **Guideline Must Know:** For **stable** AF/AFL with RVR, rate control is first-line for symptom relief and to prevent tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy; a lenient goal of **resting HR <110 bpm** is acceptable in many stable patients, but tighten to **<100 bpm** if ongoing ischemia, HF symptoms, or persistent hypotension risk. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** Choose AV‑nodal blockade based on LV function and blood pressure: beta‑blockers or non‑DHP CCBs are typical; avoid diltiazem/verapamil in suspected **HFrEF or acute decompensated HF**, where hypotension and inotropy concerns make them hazardous. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Practical night-float sequencing for stable RVR: (1) ECG confirmation and QRS width, (2) correct electrolytes toward **K⁺ ≥4.0 mmol/L** and **Mg²⁺ ≥2.0 mg/dL (≈0.8 mmol/L)**, (3) start a single rate-control strategy and reassess in **15–30 min**; avoid stacking multiple AV‑nodal agents quickly, which can precipitate bradycardia/hypotension. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** Rhythm control (pharmacologic or electrical) is appropriate when symptoms persist despite adequate rate control, when AF/AFL causes or worsens HF, or when rate control is not achievable (common in flutter); early rhythm control is emphasized in contemporary AF care pathways. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Flutter-specific pitfall: typical flutter often resists AV‑nodal blockade (rates “stuck” near **150**); do not endlessly titrate diltiazem drips—consider cardioversion when symptoms, hypotension risk, ischemia, or persistent tachycardia remain, and plan outpatient/EP ablation once stabilized. citeturn2search1turn2search11
- **Guideline Must Know:** Cardioversion safety hinges on thromboembolism risk: if AF/AFL is **>48 h or unknown**, use **≥3 weeks** therapeutic anticoagulation or a **TEE-guided** strategy, and continue anticoagulation **≥4 weeks after** cardioversion even if sinus rhythm is restored. citeturn2search11turn2search1turn2search23
- **Guideline Must Know:** Stroke prevention is not based on “paroxysmal vs persistent” alone—use validated risk stratification (e.g., CHA₂DS₂‑VASc/updated regional variants) and generally prefer DOACs over warfarin for eligible nonvalvular AF; reassess bleeding risks but do not withhold indicated anticoagulation solely due to a high bleeding score—mitigate modifiable factors instead. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Night-shift anticoagulation practicals: if cardioversion is planned urgently for instability, do not delay; start therapeutic anticoagulation as soon as safely possible after stabilization unless active bleeding or a contraindication exists, and document rationale when holding anticoagulation (e.g., active GI bleed, platelets very low, planned high-bleed procedure). citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Special risk contexts to auto-flag overnight: severe CKD/ESRD (DOAC dosing/selection constraints), cirrhosis (baseline INR unreliable; bleeding risk assessment), QT‑prolongation risk if considering ibutilide/sotalol, and ACS/PE suspicion requiring parallel pathways; call cardiology/ICU early when multiple high-risk contexts overlap. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- If pharmacologic rhythm control is selected for stable typical flutter (after QT/lytes reviewed), ibutilide can be effective but carries torsades risk—ensure **Mg²⁺ repletion** and continuous monitoring; avoid in marked QT prolongation or significant structural heart disease without expert input. citeturn2search1turn2search11
- “What must happen now” at night: identify instability, exclude pre‑excitation/wide irregular rhythm, correct electrolytes, initiate appropriate rate control, and decide whether anticoagulation/cardioversion pathway applies; “what can wait” until daylight: full trigger workup (sleep apnea counseling, long-term rhythm strategy, ablation discussion) once safe and controlled. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Common pitfalls: mislabeling MAT/atrial tach as AF (look for distinct P waves), giving adenosine for AF/AFL (it may unmask flutter but will not treat it), using diltiazem in decompensated HF, and missing pre-excited AF where AV‑nodal blockers can accelerate conduction and precipitate VF. citeturn2search11turn2search1

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Any instability attributable to tachyarrhythmia: SBP **<90 mmHg**, new ischemic chest pain, acute pulmonary edema/need for escalating oxygen/vent support, or altered mental status → cardioversion + ICU. citeturn2search13turn2search11
- Irregular wide‑complex tachycardia or suspected pre‑excited AF/AFL (WPW) or uncertainty between AF with aberrancy vs VT → immediate cardiology/ICU evaluation. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Refractory RVR despite appropriate single-agent titration, need for continuous vasopressors, or recurrent cardioversion within the same shift. citeturn2search11turn2search1
- Evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion or evolving MI/PE/stroke symptoms in the setting of AF/AFL. citeturn2search11turn2search1

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 72-year-old man with hypertension and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is admitted for pneumonia. Overnight he develops palpitations and dyspnea. Vitals: T 37.8°C, BP 118/72 mmHg, HR 156/min irregular, RR 22/min, SpO₂ 93% on 2 L/min. ECG shows atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response; no pre-excitation. Lung exam has crackles; he is not in acute pulmonary edema and mentation is normal. What is the most appropriate initial rate-control therapy?
### Options
A. Diltiazem IV bolus followed by infusion
B. Metoprolol IV boluses with reassessment
C. Adenosine IV rapid push
D. Immediate synchronized cardioversion without sedation
E. Verapamil IV bolus
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
In stable AF with RVR, initial management is rate control tailored to comorbidities; in suspected or known **HFrEF**, beta‑blockers are preferred and non‑DHP calcium channel blockers (diltiazem/verapamil) are generally avoided due to negative inotropy. citeturn2search11turn2search1 Adenosine does not treat AF, and cardioversion is reserved for instability or selected rhythm-control indications. citeturn2search11turn2search13

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 29-year-old woman with episodic palpitations presents overnight with HR 190/min and BP 124/76 mmHg. She is anxious but alert, with no chest pain or dyspnea. ECG shows an irregular wide‑complex tachycardia with beat-to-beat variability and intermittent delta waves suggestive of pre-excitation. Which is the best next medication choice?
### Options
A. Diltiazem IV
B. Metoprolol IV
C. Digoxin IV
D. Procainamide IV
E. Adenosine IV
### Correct answer
D
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This is a pitfall of **pre‑excited atrial fibrillation** (WPW) where AV‑nodal blockers (diltiazem, beta‑blockers, digoxin, adenosine) can accelerate conduction over the accessory pathway and precipitate ventricular fibrillation. citeturn2search11turn2search1 In a stable patient, **procainamide** (or ibutilide with appropriate monitoring) is an appropriate pharmacologic strategy while arranging urgent cardiology consultation; if instability develops, proceed to synchronized cardioversion. citeturn2search11turn2search13
