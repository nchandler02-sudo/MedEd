# Aortic disease (aneurysm/dissection; AAA)

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If suspected acute aortic syndrome: airway/oxygen, 2 large-bore IVs, cardiac monitor, NPO, strict bedrest, notify CT surgery/vascular early; treat pain with IV opioid to blunt sympathetic surge.
- Start anti-impulse therapy: IV beta-blocker first (e.g., esmolol bolus then infusion) to **HR <60 bpm** (or lowest tolerated) before any vasodilator.
- If SBP remains high after rate control: add vasodilator (e.g., nicardipine) to **SBP 100–120 mmHg** (or **MAP ~65–80** if end-organ perfusion concerns).
- Rapid imaging: CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis with arterial phase if stable; if unstable and CTA delayed, bedside TEE can confirm proximal dissection/tamponade.
- Hemodynamic collapse or suspected ruptured AAA: activate massive hemorrhage pathway, permissive hypotension target **SBP ~80–90 mmHg** until control, emergent OR/EVAR team activation.

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float framing: treat “aortic disease” as three urgent buckets with different moves tonight: acute dissection/IMH/PAU (anti-impulse + emergent specialty), ruptured/symptomatic AAA (hemorrhage control + OR), and incidental aneurysm (risk stratify + surveillance).
- **Guideline Must Know:** In suspected dissection, prioritize anti-impulse therapy with IV beta-blocker to reduce dP/dt before vasodilators; target **HR <60 bpm** and **SBP 100–120 mmHg** if perfusion allows (ACC/AHA Aortic Disease 2022).
- Clinical red flags that should trigger “dissection until proven otherwise”: abrupt severe chest/back/abdominal pain, syncope, pulse or BP differential, focal neuro deficits, new diastolic murmur, shock, unexplained ischemic limb/mesenteric/renal injury.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Do not give vasodilator alone in dissection because reflex tachycardia increases shear; if hypertensive, use beta-blocker first (ACC/AHA Aortic Disease 2022).
- Imaging choice tonight: CTA is first-line in stable patients (fast, widely available, maps branch vessels for malperfusion and operative planning); if renal dysfunction, weigh risk but do not delay life-saving diagnosis when suspicion is high.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Type A (ascending) dissection is a surgical emergency; immediate cardiothoracic surgery consultation and transfer to an aortic-capable center if not available (ACC/AHA Aortic Disease 2022).
- Type B (descending) dissection: uncomplicated cases are typically medical (anti-impulse + close monitoring), but “complicated” features (rupture, malperfusion, refractory pain/HTN, rapid expansion) push toward urgent TEVAR/vascular intervention.
- **Guideline Must Know:** “Complicated” dissection criteria (e.g., end-organ malperfusion, rupture/impending rupture, persistent/recurrent pain, uncontrolled BP despite IV therapy) warrant urgent specialty escalation and often endovascular repair (ACC/AHA Aortic Disease 2022).
- Malperfusion traps: rising lactate, anuric AKI, abdominal pain out of proportion, cool pulseless limb, or stroke-like symptoms can be dissection-related; treat the aortic pathology, not just the downstream organ failure.
- **Confirm Before Proceed:** If the patient looks like ACS or ischemic stroke, actively consider and exclude dissection before committing to irreversible therapies (e.g., systemic thrombolysis, emergent anticoagulation) when clinical features overlap.
- AAA basics for inpatient calls: symptomatic AAA (new abdominal/back pain, tenderness) is urgent even if not ruptured; rupture often presents with hypotension, flank/back pain, and syncope, but may be “contained” with transient stability.
- Resuscitation strategy in ruptured AAA: prioritize rapid hemorrhage control; avoid over-resuscitation that worsens bleeding—aim **SBP ~80–90 mmHg** (or mentation/perfusion endpoints) until aortic control, then normalize.
- **Guideline Must Know:** For ruptured AAA with suitable anatomy, endovascular repair is preferred when available, and systems should target rapid “door-to-intervention” timelines (SVS AAA 2018; ESVS AAA 2019).
- Incidental AAA discovered on imaging tonight: document maximal diameter and symptoms; urgent vascular referral if symptomatic, rapidly expanding, infected/mycotic concern, or large diameter (commonly **≥5.5 cm** in men, **≥5.0 cm** in women, or any symptomatic aneurysm).
- **Guideline Must Know:** Surveillance intervals matter: small AAAs require scheduled imaging, with more frequent follow-up as diameter increases (e.g., closer monitoring once **≥4.0 cm**) to reduce missed expansion/rupture risk (SVS AAA 2018; ESVS AAA 2019).
- Thoracic aneurysm and connective tissue clues: younger age, family history, bicuspid valve, Marfan/Loeys-Dietz should lower surgical thresholds and prompt family screening and consistent imaging measurement technique.
- Medication pearls: esmolol (rapid titration) is common first choice; alternatives for rate control when beta-blockers contraindicated include non-dihydropyridine CCB (diltiazem/verapamil). Add nicardipine or clevidipine if SBP remains high after rate control.
- Pitfalls that cause bad nights: treating “pain” only without BP/HR control, chasing hypertension with hydralazine (unpredictable, tachycardia), delaying consult/transfer, missing malperfusion, and giving anticoagulation/thrombolysis before considering dissection.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Suspected or confirmed Type A dissection, intramural hematoma, or penetrating ulcer involving ascending aorta, or any dissection with **shock, syncope, tamponade signs, or new severe aortic regurgitation**.
- Persistent **SBP >140 mmHg** or **HR >80 bpm** despite IV anti-impulse therapy titration, or need for continuous vasoactive infusions for BP/HR control.
- Evidence of malperfusion: rising lactate, anuria/rapid creatinine rise, mesenteric ischemia signs, focal neuro deficit, limb ischemia, or refractory metabolic acidosis.
- Suspected ruptured or symptomatic AAA, or any aneurysm with hemodynamic instability, falling hemoglobin with ongoing pain, or CT signs of leak/retroperitoneal hematoma.
- Worsening respiratory failure, altered mental status, or escalating transfusion/pressor requirements.

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 62-year-old man with long-standing hypertension develops abrupt, severe tearing chest pain radiating to the back. BP is 198/106 mmHg in the right arm and 172/94 mmHg in the left; HR 112 bpm. He is diaphoretic but alert, with a new early diastolic murmur. Oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. ECG shows nonspecific ST-T changes. Chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum. You strongly suspect acute aortic dissection and CTA is being arranged.
### Options
A. Give sublingual nitroglycerin for pain and blood pressure control
B. Start IV esmolol and titrate to **HR <60 bpm** before adding a vasodilator if needed
C. Start IV heparin for presumed acute coronary syndrome
D. Give IV hydralazine for rapid blood pressure reduction
E. Administer IV alteplase because stroke can complicate dissection
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Initial therapy is anti-impulse control to reduce aortic shear: start an IV beta-blocker and titrate to **HR <60 bpm**, then add a vasodilator to achieve **SBP 100–120 mmHg** if perfusion is adequate. Vasodilator monotherapy (nitroglycerin/hydralazine) can provoke reflex tachycardia and worsen dissection; anticoagulation or thrombolysis can be catastrophic if dissection is present.

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 58-year-old woman with severe asthma (recent ICU admission for status asthmaticus) has abrupt severe interscapular back pain and chest pressure. BP is 210/110 mmHg, HR 124 bpm, RR 22/min with diffuse wheezing, and she is anxious but mentating normally. CTA is pending for suspected acute aortic dissection. You need immediate anti-impulse therapy but are concerned about bronchospasm.
### Options
A. Start IV esmolol infusion as first-line because all beta-blockers are safe in asthma
B. Start IV diltiazem for rate control, then add nicardipine to target **SBP 100–120 mmHg**
C. Give IV hydralazine to rapidly lower systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg
D. Treat pain only and defer BP/HR control until CTA confirms dissection
E. Start IV nitroprusside immediately to rapidly reduce afterload
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
When beta-blockers are contraindicated or high risk due to active severe bronchospasm, a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker can provide rate control to reduce shear, followed by a titratable arterial vasodilator for BP. The pitfall is using vasodilator alone (or delaying control), which can increase tachycardia and aortic wall stress. What changed the decision here?

## Check Yourself Micro Questions (3–5 items)
- Q: What are the usual initial hemodynamic targets in suspected dissection after starting IV therapy?

- Q: In suspected dissection with hypertension, which comes first: beta-blocker or vasodilator?
  A: Beta-blocker first to control rate/contractility; then add vasodilator if SBP remains elevated.
- Q: What AAA size commonly triggers elective repair in average-risk men?
  A: **≥5.5 cm** (or any symptomatic aneurysm regardless of size).
- Q: What clinical feature makes a type B dissection “complicated” and changes management tonight?
  A: Malperfusion, rupture/impending rupture, refractory pain, or uncontrolled BP/HR despite IV therapy.
