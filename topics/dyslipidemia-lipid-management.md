# Dyslipidemia (lipid management)

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If **suspected statin myopathy/rhabdomyolysis**: stop statin now, check **CK**, **creatinine**, **K⁺**, UA for heme with few RBCs; start **IV isotonic fluids** targeting **UOP ≥0.5–1 mL/kg/h** and treat **hyperkalemia** if present. citeturn2search27
- If **triglycerides ≥1000 mg/dL (≥11.3 mmol/L)** or pancreatitis symptoms: make NPO, aggressive IV fluids, check lipase, glucose, anion gap; treat secondary causes (uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol, meds) and escalate early if organ failure. citeturn2search8turn2search9
- If **ACS/ischemic stroke/TIA admission**: ensure **high-intensity statin** is ordered within 24 h unless contraindicated; do not wait for outpatient follow-up if clinical ASCVD is confirmed. citeturn2search27turn2search14
- If statin is being started or uptitrated: screen for immediate contraindications (active liver failure, pregnancy, interacting drugs); choose a lower-interaction statin if on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. citeturn2search27
- Confirm before proceed: do not order irreversible/non-urgent lipid agents (PCSK9i/inclisiran) without a discharge plan for access, follow-up lipids, and documentation of maximally tolerated statin trial. citeturn2search1

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float framing: inpatient lipid decisions are usually about (1) starting/continuing **high-intensity statin** for established ASCVD or recent ACS/stroke, (2) avoiding harm from interactions/toxicity, and (3) identifying severe phenotypes (LDL-C **≥190 mg/dL** or TG **≥500–1000 mg/dL**) needing early action and reliable follow-up. citeturn2search27turn2search8
- **Guideline Must Know:** For adults with clinical ASCVD (prior MI, stroke/TIA, PAD), use **high-intensity statin** to achieve **≥50% LDL-C reduction** (atorvastatin **40–80 mg** or rosuvastatin **20–40 mg**) unless contraindicated; document “maximally tolerated statin” if dose-limited. citeturn2search27turn2search14
- **Guideline Must Know:** In very high-risk ASCVD, if LDL-C remains **≥55 mg/dL (≥1.4 mmol/L)** on maximally tolerated statin, add nonstatin therapy; if not very high risk, use LDL-C **≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L)** as the escalation threshold. citeturn2search1turn2search5
- **Guideline Must Know:** First add-on is typically **ezetimibe 10 mg daily** (oral, inexpensive, few interactions); if LDL-C remains above threshold after statin + ezetimibe, consider **PCSK9 monoclonal antibody** (alirocumab/evolocumab) or other nonstatins per access and needed % LDL reduction. citeturn2search1turn2search27
- **Guideline Must Know:** After ischemic stroke/TIA, high-intensity statin is recommended, and an LDL-C target of **<70 mg/dL** is recommended to reduce CV events; add **ezetimibe** if needed, and consider **PCSK9i** if still above goal on statin + ezetimibe. citeturn2search14turn2search16
- **Guideline Must Know:** LDL-C **≥190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L)** suggests severe hypercholesterolemia (often familial); start **high-intensity statin** regardless of calculated risk, evaluate secondary causes (hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, cholestasis), and plan close follow-up for add-on therapy if LDL remains high. citeturn2search27turn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** Diabetes (age 40–75): at least **moderate-intensity statin** for most; use high-intensity if multiple risk factors or established ASCVD, and ADA materials emphasize LDL goals around **<70 mg/dL** (primary prevention) and **<55 mg/dL** (secondary prevention) with add-ons when not at goal. citeturn2search8turn2search9
- What must happen now (common inpatient scenarios): confirm ASCVD status (problem list may be wrong), reconcile home statin intensity, restart statin held for non-reasons, and place a discharge-ready plan: dose, monitoring, and timing of lipid recheck **4–12 weeks** after start/change. citeturn2search27turn2search16
- What can wait until daytime/outpatient: coronary calcium scoring, primary-prevention risk calculation, initiation of PCSK9i/inclisiran/bempedoic acid if prior auth is uncertain, and lifestyle counseling beyond a short bedside “why this matters” statement (unless it affects discharge safety). citeturn2search1turn2search21
- Statin safety basics on nights: baseline AST/ALT if unknown and clinically indicated; routine CK not required unless symptoms. If muscle pain/weakness with CK **>10× ULN** or creatinine rise, stop statin and manage rhabdo; re-challenge later with different statin or lower dose when stable. citeturn2search27
- Interaction pitfall: avoid simvastatin/lovastatin with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, azole antifungals, many HIV protease inhibitors); if unavoidable, hold the statin or switch to pravastatin/rosuvastatin with appropriate dosing and monitoring. citeturn2search27
- Hypertriglyceridemia triage: TG **≥500 mg/dL (≥5.6 mmol/L)** increases pancreatitis risk, and TG **≥1000 mg/dL (≥11.3 mmol/L)** is high risk; inpatient focus is treating secondary drivers (uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol, certain meds) and pancreatitis care rather than “perfect lipid numbers” overnight. citeturn2search8turn2search9
- Nonstatin choices in brief (for discharge planning): ezetimibe gives modest LDL lowering; PCSK9 mAbs give large LDL lowering; inclisiran is twice-yearly maintenance after initial doses; bempedoic acid is oral and useful in statin intolerance—choose based on needed LDL reduction, adherence, and access. citeturn2search1turn2search2
- Night-float ICU call-outs: don’t delay ICU transfer for “lipid management” in shock/ACS/stroke; lipid therapy is adjunctive. Conversely, don’t miss that “mild myalgias” plus dark urine and rising K⁺ may be rhabdo requiring urgent renal-protective management. citeturn2search14turn2search27
- Documentation pearls: explicitly state indication (secondary vs primary prevention), the planned LDL-C threshold/goal (e.g., **<70 mg/dL** post-stroke or escalation thresholds **55/70 mg/dL** in ASCVD), and why deviations occurred (intolerance, interactions, hepatic failure), to prevent unintentional de-escalation at discharge. citeturn2search1turn2search16

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Suspected rhabdomyolysis with **CK ≥5000 U/L** or **rapid creatinine rise**, oliguria, or **K⁺ ≥6.0 mmol/L** or ECG changes: ICU/renal consult for electrolyte control and renal support. citeturn2search27
- Hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis plus organ dysfunction (hypotension, lactate elevation, hypoxemia, rising BUN/Cr) or severe abdominal pain with systemic inflammatory response: ICU/GI/endo consult depending on severity and local pathways. citeturn2search9turn2search8
- ACS/ischemic stroke/TIA where high-intensity statin is omitted due to uncertainty: urgent cardiology/neurology input to align secondary prevention before discharge. citeturn2search14turn2search21
- LDL-C **≥190 mg/dL** with premature ASCVD, tendon xanthomas, or strong family history: consider lipid specialist referral planning during admission to expedite familial hypercholesterolemia evaluation and add-on therapy. citeturn2search27turn2search1

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 62-year-old man is admitted with NSTEMI and undergoes successful PCI. He has prior MI 2 years ago and type 2 diabetes. He has been adherent to atorvastatin 80 mg nightly for the past year. A fasting lipid panel on hospital day 2 shows LDL-C 92 mg/dL and triglycerides 140 mg/dL. He is clinically stable and preparing for discharge. Which is the best next step to reduce future ASCVD risk?
### Options
A. Continue atorvastatin 80 mg and recheck lipids in 12 months
B. Add ezetimibe 10 mg daily
C. Switch to simvastatin 80 mg nightly
D. Add fenofibrate
E. Start niacin
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
In clinical ASCVD, patients should receive maximally tolerated high-intensity statin, and if LDL-C remains above escalation thresholds (commonly **≥70 mg/dL**, and **≥55 mg/dL** if very high risk), guideline pathways recommend adding a nonstatin, with ezetimibe typically first due to safety, oral dosing, and evidence. Rechecking lipids after therapy change is recommended within **4–12 weeks** to assess adherence and response. citeturn2search27turn2search1

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 74-year-old woman with chronic coronary disease takes simvastatin 40 mg nightly. She is started on clarithromycin for pneumonia. Two days later she develops diffuse muscle pain and weakness with dark urine. Labs show CK 12,000 U/L, creatinine 2.1 mg/dL (baseline 1.0), and potassium 5.8 mmol/L. Which is the best immediate management?
### Options
A. Continue simvastatin and add ezetimibe
B. Stop simvastatin and start aggressive IV isotonic fluids with close electrolyte monitoring
C. Reduce simvastatin to 10 mg nightly and continue clarithromycin
D. Switch simvastatin to atorvastatin 80 mg and continue clarithromycin
E. Administer a PCSK9 inhibitor now and continue simvastatin
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This presentation is consistent with statin-associated rhabdomyolysis complicated by AKI, and the immediate priority is stopping the offending statin and treating rhabdomyolysis with IV fluids and electrolyte surveillance. The pitfall is the strong CYP3A4 interaction from clarithromycin increasing simvastatin exposure, making continuation or switching within interacting regimens unsafe tonight. citeturn2search27turn2search21
What changed the decision here?

## Check Yourself Micro Questions (3–5 items)

## CDI: What to Document Clearly Tonight (3–5 bullets; NO prose)
- Dyslipidemia diagnosis with acuity/context (secondary prevention vs primary prevention) - objective LDL-C/TG values - current/intended therapy and intensity (e.g., high-intensity statin) - reason if not ordered (contraindication/intolerance)
- Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C **≥190 mg/dL**) - suspected etiology (familial vs secondary cause) - objective evidence (LDL value, family history/xanthomas if present) - treatment started and follow-up plan
- Hypertriglyceridemia severity (TG **≥500** or **≥1000 mg/dL**) - suspected cause (uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol, meds) - pancreatitis concern (symptoms/lipase/imaging) - management steps (NPO, fluids, glycemic control)
- Statin intolerance/adverse effect - symptom description - objective evidence (CK, creatinine, UA) - action taken (held/discontinued/rechallenged plan) - interaction identified if relevant (e.g., clarithromycin with simvastatin)
