# Peripheral Arterial Disease & Acute Limb Ischemia

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If acute limb ischemia suspected: assess for **6 Ps** and limb viability now; Doppler pulses, compare temps/cap refill; keep limb **dependent**, remove constrictive dressings, keep warm (no heating pad), strict **NPO**.
- Start systemic anticoagulation unless contraindicated: **unfractionated heparin IV bolus 80 units/kg (max 5000 units)** then **18 units/kg/h**; titrate to **anti-Xa 0.3–0.7 IU/mL** or therapeutic aPTT.
- Call vascular surgery emergently for any threatened limb (sensory loss, motor weakness) and do not delay transfer for imaging; give analgesia (e.g., **hydromorphone 0.2–0.5 mg IV q10–15 min PRN**) and treat shock with **MAP ≥65 mmHg**.
- Order rapid vascular imaging if it won’t delay revascularization: **CTA aorto-iliac to pedal runoff** preferred; bedside duplex if unstable/contrast risk.
- Red flags: **motor deficit/paralysis**, profound sensory loss, absent Doppler signals, severe rest pain out of proportion, or tense compartments after reperfusion (compartment syndrome) → emergent OR/ICU.
- Confirm Before Proceed: thrombolysis, emergent anticoagulation reversal decisions, and primary amputation require attending-level confirmation and documentation of contraindications/viability.

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a sudden drop in limb perfusion threatening viability; at night, your job is to rapidly classify limb as viable vs threatened, start anticoagulation, and get definitive revascularization moving while preventing “time loss” from serial exams and delayed calls.
- **Guideline Must Know:** When ALI is suspected, start systemic anticoagulation with IV unfractionated heparin promptly (unless absolute contraindication) and involve a vascular specialist early; consultation/transfer should not be delayed by imaging when the limb is threatened. citeturn2search7turn2search20
- “Threatened limb” features: rest pain with sensory loss (especially toes/forefoot), weakness, and absent Doppler signals; Rutherford IIb (motor deficit) implies salvageable but **time-critical** ischemia—revascularization is typically required **within hours**, not “in the morning.”
- **Guideline Must Know:** Use clinical severity (Rutherford class) to drive urgency and modality: viable/marginally threatened limbs may undergo imaging and planned intervention; immediately threatened (motor deficit) needs urgent revascularization; irreversible ischemia (rigid calf, profound anesthesia, nonviable tissue) may require primary amputation. citeturn2search7turn2search20
- “What must happen now”: pain control, limb positioning (dependent), heparin, NPO, broad assessment for embolic source (ECG for atrial fibrillation), and call vascular surgery; “what can wait”: full hypercoagulable workup, outpatient walking program counseling, and long-term antithrombotic fine-tuning once limb stabilized.
- **Guideline Must Know:** CTA runoff is a common first-line anatomic test when it does not delay reperfusion; duplex ultrasound can be used when CTA is unavailable or contraindicated, but threatened limbs prioritize reperfusion over perfect imaging. citeturn2search7turn2search20
- Heparin practicals: choose UFH for ALI because it is rapidly titratable and reversible; check baseline CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, creatinine; avoid subtherapeutic dosing—undertreatment increases propagation risk; if history of HIT, use non-heparin anticoagulant (e.g., argatroban) and call vascular/hematology.
- ALI etiologies matter for downstream decisions: embolus (atrial fibrillation, mural thrombus) often presents with sudden onset and no prior claudication; thrombosis-in-situ often has prior PAD symptoms and may need endovascular/surgical revascularization plus aggressive secondary prevention.
- **Guideline Must Know:** For chronic symptomatic PAD, objective diagnosis is typically by ABI; **ABI ≤0.90** supports PAD, and abnormal ABI should trigger guideline-directed medical therapy to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and limb events. citeturn2search21turn2search20
- PAD “night-float” traps: mistaking chronic PAD pain/neuropathy for ALI, missing compartment syndrome after reperfusion, and delaying anticoagulation because the foot “still looks pink.” When symptoms are acute and severe, treat as ALI until proven otherwise.
- **Guideline Must Know:** Medical therapy for symptomatic PAD includes single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) and high-intensity statin; in symptomatic PAD and after revascularization, **rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID plus low-dose aspirin** reduces major cardiovascular and limb events when bleeding risk is acceptable. citeturn2search21turn2search20
- Claudication meds: cilostazol can improve walking distance (typical **100 mg PO BID**) but is contraindicated in heart failure; do not start it in unstable inpatients or when ALI/CLTI is the concern—address limb threat first.
- Thrombolysis vs surgery: catheter-directed thrombolysis can be considered in select patients (often Rutherford I–IIa) with acceptable bleeding risk; surgery (embolectomy/bypass) is often favored for immediately threatened limbs (IIb) or when thrombolysis is contraindicated or too slow.
- Confirm Before Proceed: for planned thrombolysis, explicitly screen for recent intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke within a high-risk window, active major bleeding, recent major surgery, and uncontrolled severe hypertension; document that the limb is salvageable and that benefits outweigh bleeding risk.
- Reperfusion injury is real: after successful revascularization, monitor for hyperkalemia, acidosis, rhabdomyolysis (CK), and compartment syndrome; “pain out of proportion” with tense compartments and pain on passive stretch is an emergency—fasciotomy may be required.
- ICU/consult coordination: involve interventional radiology for endovascular options when available, cardiology for suspected cardioembolic source/anticoagulation strategy, and nephrology if severe CKD/ESRD complicates contrast decisions; but do not let consult cascades delay limb-saving intervention.

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Any limb with **motor weakness/paralysis**, rapidly progressing sensory loss, or absent arterial Doppler signals → emergent vascular surgery and likely ICU-level monitoring.
- Hemodynamic instability or need for escalating oxygen/pressor support (**MAP <65 mmHg despite fluids** or any vasopressor requirement) in the setting of ALI/possible sepsis/acute aortic syndrome.
- Post-reperfusion metabolic derangements: **K⁺ ≥6.0 mmol/L**, rising lactate with acidosis, or **CK >5000 U/L** with oliguria/AKI risk.
- Suspected compartment syndrome (tense compartments, pain with passive stretch, worsening neuro deficits) after reperfusion → immediate surgical evaluation.
- Active major bleeding risk that complicates anticoagulation/thrombolysis decisions (e.g., ongoing GI bleed, recent intracranial hemorrhage) → urgent multidisciplinary decision-making.

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 67-year-old man with atrial fibrillation not on anticoagulation develops sudden severe pain in his left leg 2 hours ago. The foot is cool and pale with delayed capillary refill. Femoral pulse is palpable but dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are absent by Doppler. He has decreased sensation in the toes but intact motor strength. Blood pressure is 148/82 mmHg and heart rate is 116/min irregularly irregular. What is the most appropriate next step?
### Options
A. Start intravenous unfractionated heparin and urgently consult vascular surgery
B. Start aspirin and schedule an ankle-brachial index in the morning
C. Obtain MRI of the leg to assess for osteomyelitis before treatment
D. Start low-dose rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin
E. Administer catheter-directed alteplase immediately without consultation
### Correct answer
A
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This presentation is acute limb ischemia with a marginally threatened limb (sensory changes without motor deficit), and immediate systemic anticoagulation with IV unfractionated heparin plus urgent vascular consultation is recommended to prevent thrombus propagation and expedite reperfusion planning. citeturn2search7turn2search20 Aspirin/ABI address chronic PAD, not ALI, and thrombolysis requires specialist planning and contraindication screening.

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 72-year-old woman with known peripheral artery disease presents with 10 hours of worsening right foot pain, numbness, and new weakness in ankle dorsiflexion. The foot is mottled and cool, and pedal pulses are absent by Doppler. She had an intracerebral hemorrhage 6 weeks ago and is now neurologically stable. What is the best next step to restore limb perfusion?
### Options
A. Catheter-directed thrombolysis with alteplase
B. Immediate surgical revascularization/embolectomy with vascular surgery
C. Discharge with outpatient vascular follow-up because symptoms are prolonged
D. Start cilostazol and supervised exercise therapy
E. Delay intervention until CTA is obtained in the morning
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This is immediately threatened ALI (motor deficit) requiring urgent revascularization, and recent intracerebral hemorrhage is a major bleeding contraindication to thrombolysis, making surgical revascularization the safer limb-salvage strategy. citeturn2search7turn2search20 The pitfall is choosing thrombolysis despite a recent intracranial bleed; imaging should not delay time-critical reperfusion.
