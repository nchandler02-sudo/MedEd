# Bradyarrhythmias & AV block; pacemakers

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)

- If unstable bradycardia (hypotension, shock, ischemic chest discomfort, acute HF, altered mental status): airway/oxygen if hypoxemic, pads on, monitor/IV, get 12-lead but **do not delay therapy**. citeturn2search19
- Give **atropine 1 mg IV bolus**, repeat **q3–5 min** to **max 3 mg** while preparing pacing. citeturn2search19
- If atropine ineffective or high-grade block suspected: start **transcutaneous pacing** (analgesia/sedation as tolerated) and call cardiology for **transvenous pacing**. citeturn2search19turn2search2
- If pacing delayed/unavailable: **epinephrine infusion 2–10 mcg/min** or **dopamine 5–20 mcg/kg/min**, titrate to perfusion and **MAP ≥65 mmHg**. citeturn2search19
- Treat reversible causes immediately (ischemia, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, medication/toxin, hypothyroid, hypothermia) and stop AV-nodal blockers. citeturn2search19turn2search2

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)

- First decision is stability: treat “symptomatic bradycardia” when bradyarrhythmia causes **hypotension**, **acutely altered mental status**, **signs of shock**, **ischemic chest discomfort**, or **acute heart failure**; do not chase rate alone. citeturn2search19
- **Guideline Must Know:** ACLS adult bradycardia sequence is **support ABCs → monitor/IV/12-lead → atropine → pacing and/or catecholamine infusion → expert consult/transvenous pacing**; keep moving if no response. citeturn2search19
- Rapid rhythm ID on ECG: sinus bradycardia vs junctional escape vs AV block. In AV block, localize: **narrow QRS** often nodal; **wide QRS escape** suggests infranodal disease and higher risk of progression/asystole (pacing threshold for escalation is lower). citeturn2search2turn2search15
- **Guideline Must Know:** In suspected high-grade or complete AV block with hemodynamic compromise, prioritize **temporary pacing** (TCP then transvenous) rather than repeated medication attempts; this is the acute pacing pathway in major bradycardia guidance. citeturn2search19turn2search2
- What must happen now: apply pacing pads early, have a second clinician prepare sedation/analgesia, and call cardiology/ICU early if any instability, recurrent syncope, or need for ongoing vasoactive support. citeturn2search19turn2search2
- **Guideline Must Know:** Atropine dosing is **1 mg IV**, repeat **q3–5 min**, **max 3 mg**; if ineffective, next steps are **transcutaneous pacing** and/or **dopamine 5–20 mcg/kg/min** or **epinephrine 2–10 mcg/min** infusion. citeturn2search19
- Common night-float reversible causes to actively look for: inferior MI/ischemia, hypoxia, hyperkalemia, hypothyroidism, hypothermia, high vagal tone, and medication/toxin (beta-blocker, non-DHP CCB, digoxin, amiodarone, clonidine). Fixing the cause may remove the pacing indication. citeturn2search19turn2search2
- **Guideline Must Know:** Before committing to irreversible device decisions, document symptom–rhythm correlation when possible and exclude reversible causes; pacing for sinus node dysfunction is typically for **symptomatic** bradycardia, not an asymptomatic number. citeturn2search2turn2search6
- Mobitz I (Wenckebach) is often nodal and may be observed if stable; Mobitz II, high-grade AV block, or complete heart block are more likely infranodal and more likely to need pacing, especially if symptoms or wide QRS. citeturn2search2turn2search15
- **Guideline Must Know:** Permanent pacemaker is indicated for persistent **Mobitz II**, **high-grade**, or **third-degree AV block** not due to a reversible/physiologic cause, and for symptomatic sinus node dysfunction when symptoms are attributable to bradycardia. citeturn2search2turn2search6
- What can wait (if stable): serial troponins/echo for ischemia workup, thyroid testing if suspected, sleep apnea screening for nocturnal bradycardia patterns, and outpatient rhythm monitoring decisions. citeturn2search2turn2search16
- Pacemaker patient at night: evaluate “device vs physiology” first. Look for failure to pace (no spikes when rate below lower limit), failure to capture (spike without QRS), undersensing/oversensing (inappropriate spikes or pauses). Get device interrogation early when symptoms recur. citeturn2search15turn2search13
- **Guideline Must Know:** In patients expected to require substantial ventricular pacing and at risk for pacing-induced cardiomyopathy or HF, physiologic pacing strategies (CRT or conduction system pacing) are recommended/considered by contemporary pacing guidance; this usually changes elective planning, not emergent stabilization. citeturn2search7turn2search8
- Pitfalls: treating “numbers” (HR 40) without symptoms; missing hyperkalemia/medication toxicity; delaying pads and sedation planning until after atropine fails; assuming all bradycardia responds to atropine; forgetting to clarify goals of care before invasive pacing in frail/terminal patients. citeturn2search19turn2search2
- Confirm Before Proceed: before transvenous pacing or permanent device decisions, confirm rhythm diagnosis (12-lead), exclude reversible causes (electrolytes/meds/ischemia), and clarify code status and procedural consent capacity when feasible. citeturn2search2turn2search15

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)

- Persistent symptomatic bradyarrhythmia with **SBP <90 mmHg**, shock, ischemic chest discomfort, acute pulmonary edema, or altered mental status despite initial atropine and temporizing measures. citeturn2search19
- Need for **transcutaneous pacing** beyond brief bridging, or any planned **transvenous pacing**. citeturn2search19turn2search2
- Suspected **Mobitz II/high-grade/third-degree AV block** with wide QRS escape, recurrent syncope, or pauses with near-arrest. citeturn2search2turn2search15
- Ongoing requirement for **epinephrine 2–10 mcg/min** or **dopamine 5–20 mcg/kg/min** to maintain perfusion. citeturn2search19
- Concern for acute ischemia/infarction driving conduction disease (new AV block with chest pain or dynamic ECG changes). citeturn2search19turn2search2

## Orders to Place Now (3–6 bullets)

- Order: Vasopressor for bradycardia bridge — {choice: epinephrine 2–10 mcg/min OR dopamine 5–20 mcg/kg/min; titrate_to: MAP ≥65 and mentation/urine output}
- Order: Bradycardia reversible-cause labs — {BMP incl K/Mg/Ca, glucose, troponin {series}, TSH if suspected, drug levels if applicable}

## ABIM Style Question 1

### Stem
A 72-year-old man is admitted for pneumonia. Overnight he becomes diaphoretic and confused. Vitals: T 37.1°C, BP 78/42 mmHg, HR 32/min, RR 22/min, SpO₂ 92% on 2 L. Telemetry shows AV dissociation with a wide QRS escape rhythm. He has cool extremities and delayed capillary refill. IV access is present and oxygen is running.

### Options
A. Administer atropine 1 mg IV and observe for 10 minutes  
B. Start transcutaneous pacing immediately while preparing for transvenous pacing  
C. Give adenosine 6 mg IV push  
D. Perform synchronized cardioversion at 100 J  
E. Give metoprolol 5 mg IV

### Correct answer
B

### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
He has unstable symptomatic bradycardia with suspected high-grade/complete AV block and a wide QRS escape, so immediate **transcutaneous pacing** is recommended while arranging expert consultation and **transvenous pacing** if needed. citeturn2search19turn2search2 Atropine may be attempted but should not delay pacing in this presentation; adenosine, cardioversion, and beta-blockade are inappropriate and may worsen hemodynamics. citeturn2search19turn2search2

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)

### Stem
A 64-year-old woman with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis missed her last session. She is somnolent with nausea. Vitals: BP 86/50 mmHg, HR 38/min, RR 18/min. ECG shows bradycardia with a widened QRS and peaked T waves. Point-of-care glucose is 118 mg/dL.

### Options
A. Give atropine 1 mg IV bolus, repeat as needed to a maximum of 3 mg  
B. Start transcutaneous pacing as the only immediate intervention  
C. Administer IV calcium gluconate immediately as membrane stabilization  
D. Give amiodarone 150 mg IV  
E. Observe on telemetry and recheck ECG in 30 minutes

### Correct answer
C

### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This is bradyarrhythmia from **hyperkalemia physiology**, where the immediate life-saving step is **membrane stabilization with IV calcium** before or alongside rate support and definitive potassium removal. citeturn2search19turn2search2 The pitfall is mistaking a reversible metabolic conduction problem for primary AV block and jumping straight to pacing without correcting potassium-driven cardiotoxicity. citeturn2search19turn2search2
