# Chest pain evaluation & stable ischemic heart disease
## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- ABCs, monitor/telemetry, IV access x2, bedside glucose; treat instability first: **MAP ≥65 mmHg**, **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia suspected). citeturn2search18
- Obtain **12-lead ECG within 10 min** of recognition; compare to prior; if ongoing pain or change, repeat ECGs q15–30 min. citeturn2search18turn2search17
- Draw **high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn) at 0 h and repeat per assay algorithm (often 1–3 h)**; interpret with symptoms/ECG and delta (not a single number). citeturn2search18turn2search21
- If suspected ACS without contraindication: give **aspirin 325 mg chew** now; give nitroglycerin if not hypotensive/RV infarct/Recent PDE5 inhibitor; treat pain/anxiety while evaluating. citeturn2search18
- Activate emergent pathway if **ST-elevation/new LBBB with ischemic symptoms**, **refractory chest pain**, or **hemodynamic/arrhythmic instability**; involve cardiology early. citeturn2search18turn2search1

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- First job at night is not “diagnose angina,” it is to exclude immediate killers: ACS, aortic syndrome, PE, tension pneumothorax, esophageal rupture, pericardial tamponade; let vitals/ECG/hypoxia focalize urgency while you parallel-process orders. citeturn2search18
- Separate acute vs stable symptoms: acute = new/change in pattern/intensity/duration; stable = chronic with consistent triggers (exertion/emotion) and relief (rest/nitro). Stable symptoms still need ACS exclusion if now worse or different. citeturn2search18turn2search17
- **Guideline Must Know:** Use a structured clinical decision pathway (CDP) for acute chest pain; low-risk is typically **30-day death/MACE <1%**, and these patients often need **no additional urgent testing** after appropriate ECG/hs-cTn assessment. citeturn2search18turn2search17
- **Guideline Must Know:** hs-cTn is the preferred biomarker; the assay-specific **99th percentile upper reference limit** defines myocardial injury, but MI diagnosis requires a compatible clinical picture and **serial testing/delta** (acute vs chronic injury). citeturn2search18turn2search21
- **Guideline Must Know:** A single hs-cTn value **below the assay limit of quantitation (LoQ)** can support MI rule-out in appropriately selected patients, especially when symptoms began **>2 h** prior, but always pair with ECG and clinical risk. citeturn2search19turn2search21
- **Guideline Must Know:** Intermediate-risk acute chest pain (not low risk, not high risk) should get additional testing targeted to benefit; if no known CAD and available, **CCTA is favored** as an anatomic test; functional stress testing is also acceptable depending on patient factors/resources. citeturn2search18turn2search17
- **Guideline Must Know:** High-risk features (new ischemic ECG changes, confirmed troponin rise/fall consistent with MI, new LV systolic dysfunction, hemodynamic instability, or high-risk CDP score) should prompt **invasive coronary angiography** consideration and cardiology involvement. citeturn2search18
- **Guideline Must Know:** For suspected NSTE-ACS, rapid hs-cTn serial algorithms (e.g., **0/1 h** or **0/2 h** where validated) can expedite safe rule-out/rule-in; if early presentation or indeterminate results, continue observation and repeat testing. citeturn2search1
- “What must happen now”: ECG + hs-cTn series + focused exam (murmur, unequal pulses, chest wall tenderness, pericardial rub), chest X-ray when alternative diagnoses likely, and continuous reassessment for dynamic ischemia or instability. citeturn2search18
- “What can wait until daylight if stable/ruled out”: definitive ischemia testing selection (CCTA vs stress modality), optimization of chronic coronary disease therapy, and shared decision-making about outpatient follow-up when appropriate and safe. citeturn2search18turn2search8
- Stable ischemic heart disease is now framed as **chronic coronary disease (CCD)**; night-float wins are: (1) confirm “stable” truly means unchanged triggers, (2) treat symptoms safely, and (3) ensure evidence-based secondary prevention is ordered/continued. citeturn2search7turn2search8
- For CCD symptom control: start/continue antianginals (beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker; add long-acting nitrate if persistent) and provide PRN sublingual nitroglycerin with hold parameters; avoid nitrates in suspected RV infarct or recent PDE5 inhibitor use. citeturn2search7turn2search18
- Secondary prevention for CCD in-hospital: ensure antiplatelet therapy when indicated, high-intensity statin unless contraindicated, BP optimization, diabetes management, smoking cessation counseling, and cardiac rehab referral planning; prioritize med reconciliation and contraindication checks overnight. citeturn2search7turn2search8
- Pitfalls: (1) labeling “NSTEMI” from a single elevated troponin in CKD/sepsis (often chronic injury or type 2 MI) without a clear rise/fall and ischemic evidence, (2) missing posterior MI (consider posterior leads), (3) stopping chronic beta-blocker abruptly, (4) giving nitrates in hypotension. citeturn2search21turn2search18
- When to call specialists: cardiology for high-risk ACS features, refractory angina, suspected vasospasm/INOCA with concerning features, complex antithrombotic decisions, or uncertain troponin dynamics; consider CT surgery/vascular for suspected acute aortic syndrome signs. citeturn2search18turn2search7

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Persistent or recurrent chest pain with **ischemic ECG changes** (new ST depression/elevation, dynamic T-wave inversion) or malignant arrhythmia. citeturn2search18
- **Hemodynamic instability**: SBP <90 mmHg, need for vasopressors, lactate elevation with suspected cardiogenic/obstructive physiology, or new pulmonary edema requiring escalating oxygen/vent support. citeturn2search18
- hs-cTn pattern consistent with acute MI plus any of: **new LV systolic dysfunction**, sustained VT/VF, syncope, or high-risk CDP score. citeturn2search18
- Concern for non-ACS catastrophic cause (suspected aortic syndrome with neuro deficit/pulse deficit, tamponade physiology, massive PE features) requiring emergent imaging/procedural capability. citeturn2search18

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 58-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia develops substernal pressure while walking to the bathroom. The pain resolves after 10 minutes of rest. Vitals are stable and exam is unremarkable. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with no ischemic ST-segment changes compared with prior. Initial hs-troponin is below the 99th percentile. Two hours later he is pain-free, and repeat hs-troponin remains low with no significant delta. He has no known coronary artery disease. What is the most appropriate next step in evaluation?
### Options
A. Discharge now without further testing or follow-up plan
B. Start heparin infusion for presumed unstable angina
C. Coronary CT angiography for further risk stratification
D. Immediate invasive coronary angiography
E. Administer alteplase for presumed acute coronary syndrome
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Patients with intermediate-risk acute chest pain and no known CAD benefit from additional testing; anatomic testing with coronary CT angiography is an appropriate strategy when available after initial ECG/hs-cTn assessment does not show high-risk features. citeturn2search18turn2search17 Heparin, invasive angiography, or thrombolysis are reserved for higher-risk presentations or STEMI-equivalents; thrombolysis is an irreversible action and requires strict STEMI criteria and system pathway. citeturn2search18

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 72-year-old woman with stage 5 CKD on hemodialysis is admitted for pneumonia. Overnight she reports mild chest tightness while coughing. ECG shows no new ischemic changes. hs-troponin is elevated above the 99th percentile at baseline and is similar to a documented prior value from last month. She is afebrile, normotensive, and oxygenating on 2 L/min nasal cannula. What is the best next step to avoid a diagnostic pitfall?
### Options
A. Diagnose NSTEMI and start heparin infusion immediately
B. Give alteplase because troponin is elevated
C. Trend serial hs-troponin and repeat ECG, focusing on rise/fall (delta) and ischemic evidence
D. Stop all antiplatelet therapy indefinitely
E. Discharge without further evaluation because troponin is chronically elevated
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
In advanced CKD, troponin can be chronically elevated; the pitfall is diagnosing MI from a single elevated value without evaluating **delta** plus clinical/ECG evidence of ischemia. citeturn2search21turn2search19 Serial hs-cTn with repeat ECG and clinical reassessment distinguishes acute MI from chronic myocardial injury or type 2 supply-demand injury in systemic illness. citeturn2search21turn2search18
