# Ventricular arrhythmias & sudden cardiac death; ICDs

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- If pulseless VF/VT: start CPR, defibrillate ASAP, give **epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO q3–5 min**, treat reversible causes; repeat shocks per ACLS. citeturn2search1
- If unstable wide-complex tachycardia with a pulse (hypotension, shock, ischemic chest pain, acute HF, AMS): **synchronized cardioversion now** (sedate if time) and place pads anteroposterior. citeturn2search1
- If torsades/polymorphic VT with prolonged QT: stop QT-prolongers, give **magnesium sulfate 2 g IV**, correct **K⁺ to ≥4.0 mmol/L** and **Mg²⁺ to ≥2.0 mg/dL (≥0.8 mmol/L)**; consider **overdrive pacing/isoproterenol** if recurrent. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- If ICD is firing repeatedly and patient is stable: monitor, treat trigger (ischemia, hypoxia, electrolytes), call EP/cardiology; consider **magnet over device to suspend shocks** only if inappropriate shocks or electrical storm while definitive therapy arranged. Confirm Before Proceed: magnet disables shocks but does not treat arrhythmia. citeturn2search8turn2search20
- Start high-yield corrections immediately: replete electrolytes, obtain 12-lead ECG, review meds for QT/Na-channel effects, evaluate for ischemia and decompensated HF; prepare for ICU if recurrent VT/VF or escalating oxygen/pressor needs. citeturn2search8turn2search21

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Night-float frame: most malignant ventricular arrhythmias at night are driven by a trigger on a susceptible substrate (ischemic scar, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, channelopathy, drug/electrolyte effect). Your first pass is simultaneous stabilization plus trigger hunt: oxygenation, perfusion, electrolytes, ischemia, medication toxicity, and device status. citeturn2search21turn2search8
- **Guideline Must Know:** Hemodynamic instability with sustained VT (or any wide-complex tachycardia presumed VT) warrants immediate **synchronized cardioversion**; do not delay for antiarrhythmic selection or rhythm “diagnosis perfection” when the patient is crashing. citeturn2search21turn2search8
- **Guideline Must Know:** For hemodynamically tolerated sustained monomorphic VT with structural heart disease, IV **procainamide** is often preferred over escalating amiodarone in stable patients when available/appropriate, while avoiding verapamil in undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia. Practical pitfall: hypotension/QRS widening during procainamide means stop and cardiovert. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- **Guideline Must Know:** Polymorphic VT with prolonged QT (torsades) is treated with **magnesium**, electrolyte correction, and heart-rate acceleration (overdrive pacing or isoproterenol) when recurrent; avoid QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol) that can worsen torsades. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- **Guideline Must Know:** Electrical storm (clustered VT/VF episodes requiring intervention, often ≥3 in 24 h) needs ICU-level care: analgesia/sedation to blunt sympathetic tone, aggressive trigger correction, and antiarrhythmic plus beta-blockade strategy; early EP involvement for catheter ablation when refractory. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- Practical antiarrhythmic choices overnight: amiodarone is broadly usable for scar-related VT and in electrical storm; lidocaine is a reasonable adjunct in ischemia-driven VT. Always pair with trigger correction and reassess blood pressure, QT/QRS, and bradycardia risk. Avoid mixing multiple QT-prolongers without a clear plan and monitoring. citeturn2search21turn2search8
- **Guideline Must Know:** ICDs are for prevention of sudden arrhythmic death; they do not prevent ventricular arrhythmias from occurring. Recurrent shocks require treating the arrhythmia and the trigger, not just “turning off the device.” Magnet use can suspend shocks transiently but does not provide pacing or terminate VT. Confirm Before Proceed: if magnet applied, ensure external defibrillation readiness. citeturn2search8turn2search20
- **Guideline Must Know:** Primary-prevention ICD candidacy is generally for patients with chronic cardiomyopathy and persistently reduced LVEF after adequate guideline-directed therapy and sufficient waiting periods (not immediately post-MI). Night-float pitfall: ordering an inpatient “ICD tomorrow” consult before confirming timing (post-MI window) and medical optimization. citeturn2search21turn2search13
- **Guideline Must Know:** In HFrEF, ICD consideration hinges on LVEF thresholds (commonly **≤35%** with symptoms and expected meaningful survival) after optimized therapy; reassess EF after treatment changes because EF improvement can change eligibility and urgency. citeturn2search13turn2search16
- ICD shock troubleshooting at 2 a.m.: determine if shock was appropriate (VT/VF) vs inappropriate (AF with RVR, lead noise). Get rhythm strips/telemetry around the event, obtain 12-lead ECG, check electrolytes, troponin if ischemia suspected, and request device interrogation early (cardiology/EP). Treat pain/anxiety; catecholamines can perpetuate storm. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- Wide-complex tachycardia pitfalls: irregular wide-complex rhythms may be AF with aberrancy or pre-excited AF; if unstable, cardiovert. If stable but uncertain, avoid AV nodal blockers that can harm pre-excited AF. When in doubt, treat as VT and seek expert help rather than “trialing” multiple agents. citeturn2search21turn2search8
- What must happen now: stabilize (airway/oxygen, BP support, defib/cardioversion as indicated), continuous monitoring/defib pads, correct electrolytes, stop offending meds (QT prolongers, stimulant infusions), and screen for ACS, decompensated HF, and sepsis/hypoxia as drivers. What can wait: detailed etiologic workup (CMR/genetics), long-term ablation planning, outpatient SCD risk stratification once safe. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- Post-arrest or post-shock care: after ROSC or termination of sustained VT, reassess perfusion, lactate, electrolytes, and acid-base status; repeat ECG for ischemia/QT; consider targeted temperature management per local protocols and early coronary evaluation when ACS is likely. Keep external pads available for recurrence. citeturn2search1turn2search21
- When to call ICU vs consult: ICU for recurrent/sustained VT/VF, escalating oxygen/pressor needs, need for deep sedation/intubation, or electrical storm; EP/cardiology urgently for recurrent shocks, suspected device malfunction, refractory VT, or need for temporary pacing/overdrive pacing. citeturn2search8turn2search20
- Documentation/hand-off pearls: capture timing and number of episodes, hemodynamic impact, therapies delivered (energy, meds, doses), suspected trigger, and whether an ICD was involved (manufacturer if known, magnet used yes/no). This is essential for EP decision-making (programming vs ablation vs med changes). citeturn2search8turn2search21

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Recurrent sustained VT/VF or suspected electrical storm (multiple VT/VF episodes requiring shocks/ATP or repeated external cardioversion) within hours. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- Any VT with hemodynamic compromise: **SBP <90 mmHg**, altered mental status, ischemic chest pain, acute pulmonary edema, or escalating vasopressor requirement. citeturn2search21
- Polymorphic VT/torsades with **QTc ≥500 ms** or recurrent runs despite magnesium and electrolyte correction, or need for overdrive pacing/isoproterenol. citeturn2search8turn2search21
- ICD delivering repeated therapies (≥2 shocks) or suspected inappropriate shocks/lead malfunction requiring urgent interrogation and reprogramming. citeturn2search8turn2search20
- Post–cardiac arrest state or persistent hypoxia/acidosis/hyperkalemia driving malignant arrhythmias despite initial correction. citeturn2search1turn2search21

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 64-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy is admitted for volume overload. He is now euvolemic on guideline-directed medical therapy. His last myocardial infarction was 2 years ago. Echocardiogram today shows LVEF 28%. He has NYHA class II symptoms at baseline. Telemetry shows occasional PVCs but no sustained arrhythmias. He has no active infection and is expected to survive >1 year. Which intervention most reduces his risk of sudden cardiac death?
### Options
A. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement for primary prevention  
B. Long-term amiodarone therapy  
C. Implantable loop recorder placement  
D. Dual-chamber permanent pacemaker placement  
E. Catheter ablation of premature ventricular complexes  
### Correct answer
A
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Primary-prevention ICD therapy is recommended for appropriate patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and persistently reduced LVEF (commonly **≤35%**) despite optimized therapy and with reasonable life expectancy, because it reduces sudden arrhythmic death. citeturn2search13turn2search21 Antiarrhythmic drugs like amiodarone may reduce arrhythmia burden but do not provide the same mortality benefit for primary prevention in this setting. citeturn2search21

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 58-year-old woman on methadone is hospitalized for pneumonia. Overnight she develops palpitations and brief syncope. Telemetry shows recurrent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with waxing/waning QRS amplitude. ECG shows QTc 540 ms. Labs reveal K⁺ 3.1 mmol/L and Mg²⁺ 1.4 mg/dL (0.6 mmol/L). Blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg between episodes. What is the best next step?
### Options
A. Start intravenous amiodarone bolus and infusion  
B. Give magnesium sulfate 2 g IV and aggressively replete potassium; stop QT-prolonging drugs  
C. Administer intravenous verapamil  
D. Start intravenous procainamide infusion  
E. Observe on telemetry because she is currently normotensive  
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This is torsades de pointes (polymorphic VT with **QTc ≥500 ms**) driven by QT-prolonging medication and electrolyte depletion; first-line therapy is **magnesium** plus correction of hypokalemia and stopping QT-prolongers, with escalation to overdrive pacing/isoproterenol if recurrent. citeturn2search8turn2search21 The pitfall is using QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) that can worsen torsades. citeturn2search8turn2search21
