# Acute decompensated heart failure & cardiogenic shock

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- Airway/breathing first: upright, continuous pulse ox, apply NIPPV for distress; target **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia). citeturn2search1
- Establish perfusion: 2 large-bore IVs, cardiac monitor, frequent BP; if hypoperfused or **MAP <65 mmHg**, start **norepinephrine 0.05–0.5 mcg/kg/min** and titrate to **MAP ≥65 mmHg** while evaluating cause. citeturn2search7
- Rapid phenotype check: “warm/wet” vs “cold/wet” (shock) using mentation, urine output, lactate, skin temp, JVP, crackles; get STAT bedside echo. citeturn2search7turn2search26
- If hypertensive pulmonary edema (SBP **≥160 mmHg**): give **nitroglycerin** (sublingual then IV) and NIPPV; avoid delaying vasodilator for diuretic onset. citeturn2search20turn2search1
- If congestion without shock: IV loop diuretic (typical **furosemide 40–80 mg IV** or **≥2×** home oral daily dose; reassess urine output in 1–2 h). citeturn2search1turn2search15
- Call ICU/cardiology early if any shock signs, rising lactate, escalating pressor/inotrope needs, or suspected ACS/mechanical complication. citeturn2search7turn2search8

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- First decide: ADHF (congestion) vs cardiogenic shock (hypoperfusion). Shock clues: **SBP <90 mmHg or MAP <65**, cool extremities, altered mentation, **UOP <0.5 mL/kg/h**, rising creatinine, **lactate ≥2 mmol/L**, narrow pulse pressure; treat as shock until proven otherwise. citeturn2search7turn2search26
- **Guideline Must Know:** In acute pulmonary edema with severe dyspnea, early **NIPPV/CPAP** reduces work of breathing and can rapidly improve oxygenation; pair with BP-appropriate therapy (vasodilators if hypertensive, pressors if hypotensive). citeturn2search20turn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** For cardiogenic shock with hypotension, prioritize restoring perfusion pressure with a vasopressor (commonly **norepinephrine**) to **MAP ≥65 mmHg** before aggressive diuresis/vasodilators; then add inotrope if low output persists. citeturn2search7
- **Guideline Must Know:** Obtain early focused echo to identify mechanism (LV failure, RV failure, tamponade, acute severe MR, VSD, PE) and to guide therapy escalation; do not “treat blind” when shock physiology is evolving. citeturn2search7turn2search8
- “What must happen now”: ECG and troponin for ischemia, CXR, bedside ultrasound, ABG/VBG if ventilatory failure, lactate, CMP/Mg/Phos, CBC, BNP/NT-proBNP when helpful; recheck response every 30–60 minutes in unstable patients. citeturn2search7turn2search1
- “What can wait (but order tonight)”: formal TTE (if bedside equivocal), medication reconciliation for GDMT restart strategy, precipitant workup (infection, arrhythmia, nonadherence, renal failure, PE, valvular disease), and disposition planning once stabilized. citeturn2search1turn2search20
- **Guideline Must Know:** IV loop diuretics are first-line for congestion without shock; a common approach is **40–80 mg furosemide IV** (or **≥2×** total home oral daily dose IV equivalent) and titrate to urine output/weight response, avoiding therapeutic inertia. citeturn2search1turn2search15
- If diuretic response inadequate: reassess adherence/absorption, confirm volume status (JVP/POCUS IVC/echo), then escalate loop dose or add synergy (e.g., metolazone) while monitoring **K⁺/Mg²⁺/Cr** closely; consider “cardiorenal” but avoid stopping diuresis solely for mild creatinine rise if still congested. citeturn2search1turn2search20
- **Guideline Must Know:** In hypertensive “flash” pulmonary edema, high-dose nitrates can provide rapid afterload/preload reduction; avoid nitrates if **SBP <90**, suspected RV infarct, or significant preload dependence. citeturn2search20turn2search7
- Inotropes: use only for hypoperfusion/low output despite adequate filling pressure and MAP support. **Dobutamine 2–20 mcg/kg/min** is rapid-on/short half-life; **milrinone 0.125–0.75 mcg/kg/min** (often without bolus) is longer-acting and renally cleared—avoid/adjust in severe CKD and hypotension. citeturn2search7
- **Guideline Must Know:** Don’t “push beta-blocker” in cardiogenic shock; hold or reduce negative inotropes (beta-blockers, non-DHP CCBs) during active hypoperfusion, then restart once euvolemic and perfusing. citeturn2search1turn2search7
- Arrhythmias commonly precipitate decompensation: treat unstable tachyarrhythmia with immediate synchronized cardioversion; for AF with RVR in decompensated HF, prefer rate control strategies compatible with hemodynamics (often amiodarone if hypotensive) and correct **K⁺ ≥4.0 mmol/L**, **Mg²⁺ ≥2.0 mg/dL**. citeturn2search1turn2search7
- **Guideline Must Know:** Use shock severity language (e.g., SCAI A–E) and reassess frequently; progression (e.g., rising lactate, escalating vasoactives) should trigger early shock team/ICU involvement and consideration of invasive hemodynamics/MCS. citeturn2search26turn2search7
- Consider pulmonary artery catheter when shock is refractory, diagnosis is unclear, RV failure suspected, or multiple vasoactive agents needed; it can distinguish “cold/wet” from vasodilatory/mixed shock and guide titration and MCS decisions. citeturn2search7turn2search26
- Pitfalls at night: mislabeling sepsis as HF (or vice versa) without objective perfusion data; giving nitrates/diuretics to a “cold/dry” patient; missing mechanical complications post-MI; intubating without hemodynamic planning (can collapse preload/afterload)—prepare pressors and consider push-dose vasopressor if needed. citeturn2search7turn2search8
- When to call consults: cardiology urgently for shock, suspected ACS, severe valvular/mechanical pathology, or refractory congestion; ICU for any vasoactives/NIPPV dependence/altered mentation; nephrology if refractory diuretic resistance with severe AKI/ESRD affecting strategy. citeturn2search7turn2search1

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Persistent hypotension: **MAP <65 mmHg** or **SBP <90 mmHg** after fluid/pressor initiation, or need for continuous vasoactives (pressor and/or inotrope). citeturn2search7
- Worsening hypoperfusion: **lactate ≥4 mmol/L**, new altered mentation, oliguria **<0.5 mL/kg/h** for 3–6 h, or rising creatinine with cool mottled extremities. citeturn2search7turn2search26
- Respiratory failure: need for NIPPV with **FiO₂ >0.6**, persistent **SpO₂ <90%**, impending fatigue, or intubation requirement. citeturn2search20turn2search1
- Suspected ACS/mechanical complication: new ischemic ECG changes, refractory chest pain, new harsh murmur/pulmonary edema after MI, or echo concern for tamponade/severe MR/VSD. citeturn2search8turn2search7
- Malignant arrhythmia or recurrent unstable tachy/bradyarrhythmias requiring cardioversion/pacing. citeturn2search7

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 68-year-old man with known HFrEF (EF 25%) presents with sudden severe dyspnea and diaphoresis. He is sitting upright, speaking in 2–3 word phrases. Vitals: T 36.8°C, HR 118/min, BP 196/108 mmHg, RR 34/min, SpO₂ 82% on nonrebreather. Exam shows diffuse rales to the apices and cool clammy skin; no fever. ECG shows sinus tachycardia without ST elevation. Which is the most appropriate immediate next management step?
### Options
A. Administer IV furosemide 80 mg and reassess in 2 hours  
B. Start noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and initiate IV nitroglycerin titrated to symptom relief and blood pressure  
C. Start dobutamine infusion for suspected low cardiac output  
D. Give IV morphine for anxiety and dyspnea control  
E. Proceed directly to endotracheal intubation without a trial of noninvasive ventilation
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
This presentation is hypertensive acute pulmonary edema; the fastest stabilizing measures are NIPPV plus afterload/preload reduction with IV nitrates while maintaining adequate blood pressure. citeturn2search20turn2search1 Diuretics are important but have slower onset, and inotropes are reserved for hypotensive hypoperfusion states. citeturn2search1turn2search7

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 72-year-old woman with chronic HFrEF (EF 20%) is admitted for worsening dyspnea and edema. Overnight she becomes lethargic and clammy. Vitals: HR 112/min, BP 84/56 mmHg (MAP 65), RR 26/min, SpO₂ 93% on 4 L nasal cannula. Labs show lactate 4.1 mmol/L and creatinine 4.3 mg/dL (baseline 1.5). Bedside echo shows severely reduced LV function without tamponade. Which is the best next step in management?
### Options
A. Start milrinone infusion and avoid vasopressors because they increase afterload  
B. Give IV nitroglycerin to reduce preload and improve pulmonary congestion  
C. Start norepinephrine to maintain MAP and add dobutamine for low-output shock physiology  
D. Give IV metoprolol to control tachycardia and improve diastolic filling  
E. Administer 2 liters of isotonic crystalloid bolus immediately
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
She has cardiogenic shock with hypoperfusion (elevated lactate, cool clammy skin) and borderline MAP; initial therapy is vasopressor support to **MAP ≥65 mmHg** with norepinephrine, then an inotrope such as dobutamine for low-output physiology. citeturn2search7 The pitfall is choosing milrinone in severe AKI/CKD (renally cleared, longer half-life) and using vasodilators/beta-blockers in active hypoperfusion. citeturn2search7turn2search1
What changed the decision here?

## Check Yourself Micro Questions (3–5 items)
- Q: In suspected cardiogenic shock, what MAP target should you titrate vasopressors to initially?  
  A: **MAP ≥65 mmHg** as an initial perfusion target, reassessing mentation, urine output, and lactate response. citeturn2search7
- Q: A patient takes furosemide 80 mg PO daily at home and is admitted for ADHF without shock; what is a reasonable initial IV furosemide dose?  
  A: **≥80 mg IV** (often **~2×** the total home oral daily dose IV equivalent, depending on severity and response). citeturn2search1turn2search15
- Q: Name the correct sequence of immediate therapies in hyperkalemia with ECG changes (relevant if AKI develops during shock).  
  A: Membrane stabilization with IV calcium, then intracellular shift (insulin/dextrose ± beta-agonist), then removal (diuresis, binders, or dialysis). 
- Q: What urine output threshold suggests hypoperfusion and should raise concern for shock?  
  A: **<0.5 mL/kg/h** (especially if sustained for several hours with other hypoperfusion signs). citeturn2search7turn2search26
