# Heart failure (HFrEF/HFpEF): diagnosis & chronic management

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- Assess ABCs, place on monitor, obtain IV access, check bedside glucose; treat life threats first: **SpO₂ ≥92%** (or **88–92%** if chronic hypercapnia suspected), **MAP ≥65 mmHg**. citeturn2search1
- If pulmonary edema/congestion: sit upright, oxygen, consider **CPAP/BiPAP** early; give loop diuretic if perfusing (e.g., **furosemide 40–80 mg IV** if on home diuretic, or **20–40 mg IV** if diuretic-naïve). citeturn2search1
- If hypertensive acute pulmonary edema: add vasodilator if no contraindication (goal SBP reduction without hypotension; avoid if RV infarct/critical aortic stenosis suspected). citeturn2search1
- If hypotension/poor perfusion: stop/hold vasodilators, evaluate for shock (POCUS, lactate, ECG, troponin), consider ICU; diurese cautiously only if congested and perfusing. citeturn2search1
- Confirm Before Proceed: if switching **ACE inhibitor → sacubitril/valsartan**, enforce **≥36 h washout** to reduce angioedema risk. citeturn2search1

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Define phenotype and stage: HFrEF **LVEF ≤40%**, HFmrEF **41–49%**, HFpEF **≥50%**; document ACC/AHA stage (A–D) and NYHA class to anchor chronic plan and coding. citeturn2search1turn2search13
- Night-float “diagnosis” essentials: confirm HF syndrome (symptoms/signs + objective evidence), look for precipitants (ischemia, arrhythmia/AF, infection, uncontrolled hypertension, medication/NSAIDs, nonadherence, renal failure), and distinguish HFpEF mimics (renal/cirrhosis/venous insufficiency, infiltrative disease, pericardial/valvular disease). citeturn2search13turn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** For suspected HF, obtain ECG, chest imaging as indicated, natriuretic peptide (BNP/NT-proBNP) when diagnosis is uncertain, and echocardiography to define EF/structure; EF category directs chronic therapy intensity and device eligibility. citeturn2search1turn2search3
- **Guideline Must Know:** For chronic HFrEF (symptomatic, stage C), foundational GDMT is 4 pillars: ARNI (preferred) or ACE inhibitor/ARB, evidence-based beta blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor; initiate early and titrate as tolerated. citeturn2search1turn2search17
- **Guideline Must Know:** Beta blockers with outcome benefit in HFrEF are **carvedilol**, **metoprolol succinate**, or **bisoprolol**; avoid starting/up-titrating during active shock, inotrope need, or severe volume overload—stabilize first. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan) is preferred over ACE inhibitor/ARB for eligible HFrEF to reduce morbidity/mortality; do not combine with ACE inhibitor and require **≥36 h** after last ACE inhibitor dose. citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** MRA (spironolactone/eplerenone) requires renal and potassium safety: generally avoid/initiate cautiously if **K⁺ ≥5.0 mmol/L** or **eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²**; recheck **K⁺/creatinine within ~3 days and 1 week** after start or dose change (or per local protocol). citeturn2search1
- **Guideline Must Know:** SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin) are recommended in HFrEF and are also recommended for HFpEF to reduce HF hospitalization/CV events; can be started inpatient when hemodynamically stable and not in ketoacidosis. citeturn2search1turn2search13turn2search17
- HFpEF chronic management is comorbidity-first: optimize blood pressure (target **SBP <130 mmHg** when tolerated), manage obesity, diabetes, AF, sleep apnea; use diuretics for congestion; consider ARNI/ARB/MRA in selected patients per consensus pathway. citeturn2search13turn2search1
- Diuretic strategy (both phenotypes): treat congestion to euvolemia, then reduce to lowest dose that maintains dry weight; monitor **urine output**, daily weights, and BMP/Mg; beware “renal function bump” vs true hypoperfusion—trend creatinine with volume exam. citeturn2search1
- What must happen now (tonight): reconcile home GDMT; hold/adjust only for objective instability (e.g., **SBP <90 mmHg with symptoms**, rising lactate/shock, severe AKI, **K⁺ ≥5.5 mmol/L**); correct missed doses; ensure discharge-critical meds are restarted once stable. citeturn2search1
- What can wait (day team): ischemic evaluation if indicated, outpatient titration plan, cardiac rehab referral, advanced therapies/device screening timing, and detailed education; but leave a clear “next titration step” note (dose targets and lab follow-up). citeturn2search1turn2search3
- Device/advanced therapy flags: for chronic HFrEF after **≥3 months** of optimized GDMT and persistent **LVEF ≤35%**, evaluate for ICD/CRT per criteria; early specialty referral for recurrent admissions, end-organ dysfunction, or intolerance to GDMT. citeturn2search1turn2search13
- Common night-float pitfalls: stopping beta blocker abruptly (rebound tachy/ischemia), giving excess IV fluids for mild creatinine rise despite congestion, missing new AF with RVR/ischemia as precipitant, and failing to document EF phenotype and acuity (“acute on chronic”). citeturn2search1turn2search13
- Consult triggers within chronic management: cardiology for new HFrEF, uncertain HFpEF diagnosis needing advanced testing (H2FPEF/HFA-PEFF), refractory congestion, GDMT intolerance, suspected amyloidosis/valvular/pericardial disease, or consideration of advanced therapies. citeturn2search13turn2search1

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Need for escalating respiratory support: **CPAP/BiPAP** requirement or **FiO₂ ≥0.6** to maintain target oxygenation, or rising CO₂ with fatigue/altered mental status. citeturn2search1
- Hemodynamic instability: **MAP <65 mmHg** despite initial measures, new pressor/inotrope requirement, or signs of hypoperfusion (cool extremities, oliguria, rising lactate). citeturn2search1
- Malignant arrhythmia or ACS concern: sustained VT/VF, unstable AF with RVR, ischemic ECG changes with symptoms/troponin rise requiring urgent cardiology evaluation. citeturn2search1
- Worsening end-organ dysfunction with congestion: rapidly rising creatinine/oliguria, severe transaminitis, or refractory volume overload despite appropriate loop diuretic dosing. citeturn2search1

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 62-year-old man with chronic heart failure is admitted for community-acquired pneumonia. He is now improving and euvolemic. His prior echocardiogram shows LVEF 30%. Home medications include lisinopril, carvedilol, and furosemide. Vitals: BP 112/68 mmHg, HR 68/min, SpO₂ 95% on room air. Labs: K⁺ 4.4 mmol/L, creatinine 1.0 mg/dL (eGFR 78 mL/min/1.73 m²). Which medication change best improves long-term outcomes before discharge?
### Options
A. Add dapagliflozin
B. Add verapamil
C. Stop carvedilol to prevent bradycardia
D. Switch lisinopril to losartan without additional precautions
E. Increase furosemide dose to the maximum tolerated dose indefinitely
### Correct answer
A
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended foundational therapy for chronic symptomatic HFrEF and can be initiated in stable, euvolemic inpatients to reduce HF hospitalization and cardiovascular events. citeturn2search1turn2search17 Verapamil is not GDMT for HFrEF, stopping beta blockers abruptly is harmful, and diuretics treat congestion but do not replace mortality-reducing therapies. citeturn2search1

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 70-year-old woman with chronic HFrEF (LVEF 25%) is admitted with mild volume overload that improves after IV diuresis. The day team plans to start spironolactone for guideline-directed therapy. Overnight labs return: K⁺ 5.6 mmol/L and creatinine 2.2 mg/dL (eGFR 26 mL/min/1.73 m²). She is hemodynamically stable (BP 118/70 mmHg). What is the best next step regarding spironolactone?
### Options
A. Start spironolactone 25 mg nightly and recheck potassium in 1 month
B. Start spironolactone 12.5 mg daily with no additional monitoring
C. Defer spironolactone and address hyperkalemia/renal dysfunction first
D. Start spironolactone and add routine potassium supplementation
E. Replace spironolactone with verapamil for neurohormonal blockade
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
MRAs increase hyperkalemia risk and are generally avoided or deferred when **K⁺ is elevated (e.g., ≥5.0 mmol/L)** and when **eGFR is markedly reduced (e.g., <30 mL/min/1.73 m²)**; correcting the pitfall (hyperkalemia with advanced CKD) comes first. citeturn2search1 Starting an MRA here risks dangerous arrhythmia and worsening renal dysfunction; if later initiated, potassium/creatinine require close early monitoring. citeturn2search1
