# Adult congenital heart disease basics

## Panic Card (3–6 bullets)
- ABCs + monitors; treat shock early with **MAP ≥65 mmHg** (arterial line if unstable) and avoid prolonged hypotension in cyanotic/Fontan physiology
- Oxygen and ventilation: give O₂ for distress; avoid sudden high PEEP and aggressive hyperventilation in pulmonary hypertension/Fontan (can drop preload and worsen output); target **SpO₂ to patient baseline** while stabilizing
- Rhythm first in “single-ventricle/Fontan”: if atrial flutter/fibrillation with hypotension, altered mental status, ischemia, or shock, do **synchronized cardioversion now** (do not “rate-control and wait”)
- Volume strategy: assess bedside (JVP, edema, lung US); Fontan/right-sided failure may need cautious fluids (e.g., **250 mL boluses**) while avoiding overload; Eisenmenger may crash with both hypovolemia and excessive vasodilation
- Prevent paradoxical emboli/air: if known or suspected intracardiac shunt, use **air-eliminating IV filters** and meticulous de-airing for all lines/injections
- Confirm Before Proceed: thrombolysis, emergent anticoagulation reversal, or major transfusion decisions—verify anatomy/repair status, baseline SpO₂, and anticoagulant use; involve ACHD/cardiology early for irreversible actions

## Brief Overview (450–700 words total; bulleted; 12–20 bullets)
- Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is not “fixed” after childhood repair: many have residual shunts, valve disease, arrhythmia substrates, pulmonary hypertension, or systemic right ventricle failure; at night, your first job is to identify the physiology that will decompensate with routine interventions (fluids, diuretics, intubation, rate-control)
- **Guideline Must Know:** Moderate/complex ACHD should be co-managed with an ACHD-experienced cardiologist/center; if the patient is unstable, call cardiology early and treat like a high-risk structural heart patient, not like routine CHF/AF
- Build a 60-second “anatomy + physiology” summary from chart/echo: lesion and repairs (e.g., Fontan, atrial switch, RV-PA conduit), ventricular type (left vs systemic RV), valve lesions, shunt direction, pulmonary pressures, baseline SpO₂, and whether there is prosthetic material that changes infection/anticoag decisions
- **Guideline Must Know:** Use an anatomic complexity plus physiologic status mindset (symptoms, cyanosis, ventricular/valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, end-organ dysfunction) to risk-stratify urgency; the same “defect name” can behave very differently depending on physiologic stage
- Night-float pitfall: treating tachyarrhythmias as “standard AF.” Many ACHD lesions (Fontan, systemic RV, atrial switch) are preload- and atrial-contraction dependent; rapid atrial arrhythmias can cause abrupt low output, hepatic congestion, thrombosis risk, and need early rhythm control rather than slow titration of AV nodal blockers
- **Guideline Must Know:** In Fontan or severe pulmonary hypertension physiology, avoid precipitous drops in preload and systemic vascular resistance; large doses of vasodilators, deep sedation, and high PEEP can acutely reduce pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output—stabilize hemodynamics first and escalate airway support with experienced help
- Cyanosis basics: chronic hypoxemia may be baseline (e.g., **SpO₂ 80–90%**); do not “normalize” saturation at the expense of hypotension or high airway pressures; evaluate new hypoxemia for pneumonia/PE, shunt change, arrhythmia, or worsening pulmonary hypertension
- **Guideline Must Know:** Suspected intracardiac shunt or cyanotic CHD = treat IV air as dangerous; use air-eliminating filters and strict de-airing to reduce paradoxical embolus risk during routine night care (IV meds, contrast, line access)
- Eisenmenger basics (right-to-left shunt from severe pulmonary vascular disease): hypovolemia, anemia, acidosis, and hypoxia can worsen shunting; avoid dehydration and excessive vasodilation; manage sepsis with cautious fluids plus early vasopressors to maintain systemic perfusion
- **Guideline Must Know:** Pulmonary hypertension in ACHD (especially Eisenmenger) is a consult trigger—avoid empiric high-dose diuresis or aggressive nitrates without hemodynamic assessment; intubation can be high risk and should be planned with ICU/cardiology when possible
- Heart failure phenotypes differ: systemic RV failure (e.g., congenitally corrected TGA or atrial switch) may not respond like typical LV HFrEF; prioritize congestion relief, rhythm control, and specialist input rather than assuming standard pathways will be tolerated
- **Guideline Must Know:** Endocarditis prevention: prophylactic antibiotics are reserved for the highest-risk cardiac conditions (e.g., prosthetic valves/material, prior endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic CHD, repaired CHD with residual defects adjacent to prosthetic material) and mainly for specific dental procedures—do not order “routine” GI/GU prophylaxis
- Anticoagulation is anatomy-specific: atrial arrhythmias in ACHD often carry higher thromboembolic risk than non-CHD AF; prior atriotomy/Fontan pathways and atrial dilation matter—if new atrial flutter/fibrillation is present, involve cardiology and assess for anticoag need and cardioversion timing
- Imaging strategy at night: bedside echo is powerful for “is there ventricular dysfunction, pericardial effusion, gross RV strain, severe valve regurg/stenosis, or shunt suspicion”; avoid delaying stabilization for advanced imaging, but recognize that congenital anatomy can make standard windows and interpretations tricky
- Common inpatient hazards to anticipate: line placement challenges (venous occlusions, altered anatomy), renal/hepatic congestion (Fontan-associated liver disease), polycythemia/hyperviscosity (cyanosis), and arrhythmia recurrence—review prior operative notes and the most recent congenital echo/CMR summary when available
- What can wait until morning if stable: detailed lesion classification, elective imaging planning (CMR/CT), long-term anticoag choice nuances, and nonurgent medication optimization—your overnight goal is safe stabilization, early recognition of high-risk physiology, and preventing iatrogenic collapse

## Top ICU/Consult Triggers (3–5 bullets)
- Sustained hypotension or shock: **MAP <65 mmHg** despite initial resuscitation or need for vasopressor support; especially high risk in Fontan/Eisenmenger/systemic RV
- New or recurrent atrial flutter/fibrillation or wide-complex tachycardia with any instability: syncope, ischemia, lactate rise, oliguria, or **SBP <90 mmHg**
- Escalating respiratory support: need for **FiO₂ ≥60%**, new **HFNC/NRB**, rising CO₂, or impending intubation in pulmonary hypertension/Fontan physiology
- Evidence of decompensated right-sided/Fontan failure: rapidly rising bilirubin/INR, tense ascites, worsening encephalopathy, or refractory volume overload with renal dysfunction
- Suspected endocarditis, thrombosis, or paradoxical embolic stroke/TIA in a patient with shunt/prosthetic material, especially with persistent fever or positive blood cultures

## Orders to Place Now (3–6 bullets)
- Order: Telemetry monitoring — {indication: suspected arrhythmia/ACHD high risk; parameters: notify for HR >{150} or <{40}, pauses >{3} s}
- Order: ECG 12-lead now and repeat after intervention — {symptoms: palpitations/chest pain/syncope; include prior ECG for comparison if available}
- Order: Labs: CBC, CMP, magnesium, phosphate, venous blood gas with lactate, troponin — {frequency: now; repeat lactate in {2–4} h if elevated or shock}
- Order: Transthoracic echocardiogram (STAT if unstable) — {question: ventricular function/valve lesion/pericardial effusion/pulmonary pressures; note: “adult congenital heart disease history”}
- Order: IV access with air-eliminating filter — {if shunt suspected/known; line type: peripheral/central; ensure meticulous de-airing}
- Order: Cardiology consult — {reason: ACHD physiology + {arrhythmia/shock/hypoxemia}; urgency: {STAT|urgent}}

## ABIM Style Question 1
### Stem
A 30-year-old man with a history of single-ventricle palliation with Fontan procedure is admitted for gastroenteritis. His baseline oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Overnight he develops palpitations and lightheadedness. Vitals: T 36.8°C, HR 165/min, BP 84/52 mmHg, RR 22/min, SpO₂ 86% on 2 L/min nasal cannula. ECG shows a regular narrow-complex tachycardia consistent with atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction. He is diaphoretic and confused.
### Options
A. Give IV diltiazem and reassess in 30 minutes  
B. Give IV metoprolol and schedule cardiology evaluation in the morning  
C. Perform synchronized cardioversion now  
D. Start IV amiodarone infusion and observe for response  
E. Administer a 2 L crystalloid bolus before any rhythm intervention
### Correct answer
C
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
Fontan physiology is highly dependent on atrial contribution and low pulmonary vascular resistance; rapid atrial arrhythmias can precipitate acute low cardiac output and shock. In an unstable tachyarrhythmia, immediate **synchronized cardioversion** is the recommended first step, rather than delayed pharmacologic rate control. Large empiric fluid boluses and AV nodal blockers can worsen hemodynamics if they delay definitive rhythm restoration.

## Second ABIM Style Case (Pitfall Variant)
### Stem
A 30-year-old man with Fontan physiology develops atrial flutter overnight with HR 150/min and BP 118/72 mmHg. He is comfortable, mentating normally, and denies chest pain. The time of onset is unclear; nursing notes suggest intermittent palpitations for “the last couple of days.” He is not on anticoagulation. ECG confirms atrial flutter.
### Options
A. Synchronized cardioversion immediately without further evaluation  
B. Begin therapeutic anticoagulation and plan cardioversion only after transesophageal echocardiography or after ≥3 weeks of anticoagulation  
C. Give IV diltiazem and discharge the patient from telemetry once HR <110/min  
D. Start aspirin alone and schedule elective cardioversion after discharge  
E. Administer IV adenosine to terminate the rhythm
### Correct answer
B
### Rationale (2–4 sentences)
When atrial flutter duration is **>48 hours or unknown** and the patient is stable, cardioversion should be preceded by adequate anticoagulation or a transesophageal echocardiography-guided strategy to reduce thromboembolic risk. The pitfall is assuming congenital anatomy lowers embolic risk; in ACHD (especially Fontan), atrial dilation and prior atrial surgery increase thrombosis risk. Rate control alone does not address stroke prevention or the high recurrence/instability risk in this physiology.
What changed the decision here?

## Check Yourself Micro Questions (3–5 items)
- Q: In an ACHD patient with suspected right-to-left shunt, what is the key bedside safety step for IV therapy?
  A: Use air-eliminating filters when possible and meticulously de-air all IV tubing/syringes to reduce paradoxical air embolism risk.
- Q: For unstable atrial flutter in a Fontan patient, what is the immediate intervention?
  A: Immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated when there is hypotension, shock, ischemia, or altered mental status.
- Q: What oxygen saturation target should you use overnight for a chronically cyanotic ACHD patient?
  A: Target the patient’s documented baseline saturation while treating distress; do not force normalization if it compromises hemodynamics.
- Q: What is the cardioversion timing threshold that changes anticoagulation strategy in stable atrial flutter/fibrillation?
  A: If duration is >48 hours or unknown, cardioversion should follow ≥3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TEE-guided approach.
